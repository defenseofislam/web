        <Text underline><Title level={2}>Religious People (Muslims) only worship out of greed[Paradise] or out of fear[Hellfire] - Brutal Refutation </Title></Text>
        <Title level={4}>Introduction</Title>

<Paragraph>
  The claim that Muslims—or religious people in general—only worship out of <Text mark>greed for Paradise</Text> or <Text type="danger">fear of Hellfire</Text> is not just ignorant—it’s embarrassingly shallow. It’s the kind of “critique” you’d expect from someone whose philosophy is built on <Text code>Reddit threads, YouTube shorts, and caffeine-fueled nihilism</Text>. <Text italic>They reduce 1,400 years of spiritual tradition, scholarship, sacrifice, and divine love to some cosmic bribe system.</Text><br /><br />

  But let’s flip the mirror: <Text type="warning">you worship dopamine</Text>, validation, and fleeting pleasure. You chase likes on Instagram, not divine mercy. Your “freedom” is slavery to impulses. Your morality changes with hashtags. Yet you call devotion to the All-Knowing “greedy”? <Text strong>At least we fear something higher than a social media algorithm.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text underline>This isn’t worship out of greed or fear—it’s worship out of love, awe, and recognition of truth.</Text> Muslims pray not because they’re scared puppets, but because they know their Creator deserves every prostration, every breath. <Text code>Fear and hope are human—but love for Allah is divine.</Text><br /><br />

  So before mocking belief, ask yourself: <Text type="success">what do you actually live for?</Text> And more importantly, <Text type="danger">what will you die for?</Text>
</Paragraph>



<hr />

<Text underline><Title level={4}>1. Projection of the Perverted: You See Greed Because You Breathe It
</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  Let’s not pretend these trolls care about <Text strong>sincerity</Text> or <Text strong>theology</Text>. Their mockery—<Text code>“Moozliims only worship for hoors!”</Text>—isn’t some clever insight. <Text italic>It’s projection.</Text> They mock Muslims for rewards because their entire worldview is built on <Text mark>selfish pleasure</Text>. These are the same people who:

<br /><br />

<Text type="danger">Treat sex as a hobby.</Text><br />
<Text type="danger">Cheat in relationships and call it “freedom.”</Text><br />
<Text type="danger">Chase dopamine through OnlyFans, porn, drugs, and temporary highs.</Text>

<br /><br />

So when they see Muslims <Text underline>praying five times a day</Text>, <Text underline>fasting without food or drink</Text>, <Text underline>giving zakat</Text>, <Text underline>lowering their gaze</Text>—they can’t imagine doing that without instant gratification. Because they’re <Text type="warning">spiritually bankrupt</Text>. They see everything through the lens of <Text code>lust, greed, and ego</Text>, so they assume everyone else must too.

<br /><br />

But here’s the difference: <Text type="success">You sell your soul for dopamine.</Text> <Text type="success">We sacrifice ours for discipline.</Text>
</Paragraph>



<Text underline><Title level={4}>2. The Hoors Obsession: You Talk More About It Than Muslims Do</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Let’s be brutally honest.</Text>

  <br /><br />

  Nobody brings up <Text mark>hoors</Text> more than atheist trolls. You'd think they were preparing to write <Text italic>Fifty Shades of Jannah</Text>. You scroll through their tweets and Reddit posts, and every few minutes it’s: <Text code>“Hurr durr, Moozlims wanna get laid in paradise!”</Text>

  <br /><br />

  <Text strong>Fact check:</Text> The <Text mark>hoors</Text> are mentioned in a <Text strong>handful</Text> of verses, alongside descriptions of <Text italic>rivers, peace, palaces, and eternal light</Text>. But of course, your <Text type="warning">porn-scrambled brains</Text> only see “girls.” You could put these trolls in front of <Text code>Surah Ad-Dukhan</Text> or <Text code>Surah Ar-Rahman</Text>, and they’d skip over the parts about <Text strong>mercy</Text>, <Text strong>fear of Hell</Text>, or <Text strong>love of Allah</Text>, just to find the word <Text type="success">“hoor”</Text> or <Text type="success">“virgin”</Text> and foam at the mouth.

  <br /><br />

  You mock hoors while:

  <br />
  <Text type="danger">Paying to watch half-naked girls on Twitch and calling it “simping.”</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">J**king off to hentai and pretending it's “art.”</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">Having “open relationships” because you're too weak for commitment.</Text>

  <br /><br />

  <Text type="success">If hoors offend you, maybe it’s because you’ll never see anything pure—in this life or the next.</Text>
</Paragraph>





<Text underline><Title level={4}>
3. The Irony: You Wouldn’t Worship God Even If Hell Opened Beneath You</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>You accuse Muslims of being “reward-hungry.”</Text> Yet <Text underline>you wouldn’t worship God even if He gave you NOTHING—or EVERYTHING.</Text> <Text type="danger">Your arrogance is louder than your intellect.</Text> Even if:

  <br /><br />
  <Text mark>God spoke to you directly.</Text><br />
  <Text mark>Showed you Jannah and Jahannam.</Text><br />
  <Text mark>Made the earth split under your feet...</Text>

  <br /><br />

  …you would still say, <Text code>“Coincidence.”</Text>

  <br /><br />

  Because <Text type="warning">your problem isn’t about evidence or sincerity.</Text> <Text strong>Your ego is your god.</Text> <Text type="danger">You can’t stand the idea of someone Greater than you.</Text> That’s why you mock Muslims—<Text italic>because we bowed our heads in sajdah, and you couldn’t even bend your pride.</Text>
</Paragraph>




<Text underline><Title level={4}>
4. Brutal Reality Check: Your Life Has No Ultimate Meaning
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>You laugh at hoors. You mock Muslims.</Text> But here’s your <Text type="warning">sad little truth</Text>:

  <br /><br />
  <Text type="danger">You don’t know why you exist.</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">You don’t know what happens after death.</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">You have no moral compass besides public opinion.</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">You worship trends, trauma, and TikTok.</Text>

  <br /><br />

  <Text type="success">And when the ground calls you back, no memes will save you.</Text><br />
  <Text italic>No “enlightened” Reddit post will comfort you.</Text><br />
  <Text mark>All that mockery turns into terror when the angel says, “Who is your Lord?”</Text>

  <br /><br />

  <Text strong>Your life has no meaning unless Allah gives it meaning.</Text> And all your sarcasm and likes and <Text delete>“haha hoors!”</Text> jokes won’t stop your soul from screaming when that Day comes.
</Paragraph>




<Text underline><Title level={4}>5.“You Don’t Need Fear to Be Good!” – Then Explain Serial Killers, Porn Empires, and Genocides
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>If fear isn't necessary, why does society:</Text>

  <br /><br />
  <Text type="warning">Have police?</Text><br />
  <Text type="warning">Use jail time as deterrence?</Text><br />
  <Text type="warning">Threaten consequences for wrongdoing?</Text>

  <br /><br />
  <Text strong>Because fear restrains evil.</Text> Without consequences, humans turn into <Text type="danger">beasts</Text>. Look at any lawless zone—<Text type="danger">people steal, rape, kill.</Text> That’s your <Text delete>"fearless morality"</Text> in action.

  <br /><br />
  Atheists claim morality can exist without religion—but <Text italic>can't even agree</Text> on what <Text mark>"good"</Text> is.<br />
  One says <Text code>cheating is evil</Text>. Another says <Text code>"If it makes you happy, do it."</Text><br />
  <Text strong><Text type="danger">No fear</Text> = <Text type="danger">no brake pedal.</Text></Text> Just <Text type="warning">pure hedonistic chaos.</Text>
</Paragraph>



<Text underline><Title level={4}>6. “Fear Doesn’t Make You Moral”? Tell That to a Toddler and a Rapist
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Even basic parenting involves <Text code>“don’t touch the fire or you’ll get burned.”</Text><br />
  We teach children <Text mark>fear first</Text>, because their instincts don’t yet understand consequence.

  <br /><br />
  So when an <Text type="danger">atheist troll</Text> says, <Text code>“Fear doesn’t make you good,”</Text> they’re arguing against how <Text strong>all human civilization</Text> was built. Laws, ethics, rules—<Text italic>all rooted in consequence</Text>.

  <br /><br />
  <Text strong>We fear Hell</Text> not because we lack morals, but because we <Text type="success">respect justice</Text>. And in a world where:

  <br /><br />
  <Text type="danger">War criminals walk free,</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">Rapists get bail,</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">Tyrants die peacefully...</Text>

  <br /><br />
  <Text underline>…Hell is the only courtroom where justice is never delayed.</Text>
</Paragraph>


<Text underline><Title level={4}>7. "Be Good Without God"? You Can’t Even Be Consistent Without Him</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Atheists say: <Text code>“If you're only good because of fear of Hell, then you're fake.”</Text><br />
  But here’s the trap:

  <br /><br />
  They define <Text type="warning">“good” based on feelings.</Text><br />
  They <Text delete>change morals every decade</Text> and call it “progress.”<br />
  They have <Text mark>no eternal source</Text> for right and wrong—just trends, polls, and Tumblr quotes.

  <br /><br />
  So their “goodness” is <Text italic>just vibes and hashtags.</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">One day it’s “my body, my choice.” The next it’s “ban your opinions.”</Text><br />
  Tomorrow they'll <Text type="danger">cancel you</Text> for something they celebrated yesterday.

  <br /><br />
  <Text strong>Islamic morality is timeless.</Text> What was <Text code>haram</Text> 1400 years ago is <Text code>haram</Text> today—because it’s not built on <Text delete>moods</Text> or <Text delete>memes</Text>. It’s built on <Text strong>Divine Wisdom</Text>.

  <br /><br />
  <Text type="success">You can’t be “good” if good itself is undefined.</Text><br />
  You scream about “ethics” while applauding OnlyFans, normalizing drugs, and teaching children there's no such thing as truth.<br />
  <Text type="danger">You mock Hell, yet your world is on fire—and you still call it freedom.</Text>

  <br /><br />
  <Text underline>You abandoned God—and now even common sense has abandoned you.</Text>
</Paragraph>


<Text underline><Title level={4}>8.  Fear of Allah vs. Fear of Society: You Choose Your Chains
</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  The atheist obeys law not because it’s <Text strong>right</Text>—but because they fear:
  <br /><br />
  <Text type="warning">Jail.</Text><br />
  <Text type="warning">Public shame.</Text><br />
  <Text type="warning">Getting caught.</Text>
  <br /><br />
  So when they say, <Text code>“Fear of God is fake morality,”</Text> they’re not just wrong—they’re <Text type="danger">lying</Text>.
  <br /><br />
  They obey out of fear too. But their fear is <Text delete>cheap</Text>, <Text delete>social</Text>, and <Text delete>temporary</Text>.
  <br /><br />
  A Muslim fears <Text mark>Allah—the All-Knowing.</Text><br />
  We don’t just behave in public. We fear <Text italic>backbiting</Text> even in <Text italic>whispers</Text>.<br />
  We <Text underline>lower our gaze</Text> even when <Text strong>no one is watching</Text>.<br />
  We return a lost wallet—even if the owner will <Text italic>never know</Text>.
  <br /><br />
  <Text type="success">That’s not weakness. That’s sacred accountability.</Text>
</Paragraph>


<Text underline><Title level={4}>9.  You Fear Rejection, Aging, and Death—But Not God? That’s Not Bravery. That’s Delusion.</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  They say, <Text code>“Why fear an invisible god?”</Text><br /><br />

  But they fear:<br />
  <Text type="warning">Being single forever.</Text><br />
  <Text type="warning">Losing followers.</Text><br />
  <Text type="warning">Their parents finding their browser history.</Text>
  <br /><br />

  Their lives are built on fear—but of <Text delete>useless things</Text>.<br />
  <Text mark>We fear the Creator of Death.</Text> They fear the opinions of <Text italic>strangers on the internet</Text>.
  <br /><br />

  <Text type="success">A Muslim’s fear brings peace, structure, and meaning.</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">An atheist’s fear breeds anxiety, depression, and nihilism.</Text>
  <br /><br />

  They mock us while spiraling into <Text italic>panic attacks</Text> over rent and self-worth.<br />
  <Text underline>We sleep after tahajjud.</Text> <Text delete>They scroll through 3 AM existential dread.</Text>
</Paragraph>




<Text underline><Title level={4}>10.  The Real Reason Muslims Worship: Love, Fear, Loyalty

</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
    Muslims worship not because of <Text italic>“hoors,”</Text> but because of a <Text strong>profound, multilayered relationship</Text> with their Creator:
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text underline>Out of love</Text> – Allah gave us <Text mark>life</Text>, <Text mark>breath</Text>, <Text mark>intellect</Text>, <Text mark>family</Text>, <Text mark>rain</Text>, <Text mark>food</Text>, <Text mark>health</Text>.
    <br />
    <Text type="success">“Which of the favors of your Lord will you deny?”</Text> (<Text code>Qur’an 55:13</Text>)
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text underline>Out of fear</Text> – Of <Text type="danger">accountability</Text>, of <Text type="danger">our own sins</Text>, of <Text type="danger">Hellfire</Text>—a reality far more terrifying than any manmade punishment.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text underline>Out of awe</Text> – A deep, trembling awareness that <Text strong>Allah is perfect, eternal, and above all things.</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text underline>Out of hope</Text> – That the <Text mark>Most Merciful</Text> will forgive us when no one else will.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    We don’t just worship for reward.
    <br />
    We worship because even if there was <Text delete>no Jannah</Text>, <Text strong>He still deserves it</Text>.
    <br />
    And if there was <Text delete>no Jahannam</Text>, <Text strong>He still has the right</Text>.
    <br />
    <Text type="warning">We pray because He is Allah. Full stop.</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
    But you wouldn’t understand that—because you’ve never loved something bigger than your mirror.
  </Paragraph>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>  A Final Word to the Atheists

</Title></Text>

 <Paragraph>
    To the <Text type="danger">atheist trolls</Text>: If you’re going to criticize, at least be <Text strong>sincere</Text>. Don’t reduce Islamic faith to internet memes and strawman arguments.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    And to those who say: <Text italic>“If you need fear and reward to be good, then you are not naturally good.”</Text>
    <br />
    Know this:
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text strong>Islam calls to a higher standard</Text>—not just being “naturally good,” but being <Text mark>accountable</Text>, <Text underline>conscious of the unseen</Text>, and <Text strong>dedicated to justice</Text> even when no one is watching.
    <br />
    <Text type="warning">Fear and hope are not flaws.</Text> They’re signs of <Text italic>humility</Text>—the kind that prevents arrogance and guides us to something greater than ourselves.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    If fear of Hell stops a man from oppressing others,
    <br />
    and hope for Paradise inspires him to lift the oppressed—
    <br />
    <Text type="success">then that is not weakness. That is moral clarity.</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
    In the end, we all serve something. Be sincere enough to ask what yours truly is.
  </Paragraph>
