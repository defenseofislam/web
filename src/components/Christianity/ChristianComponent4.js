<Paragraph>
  This article explores the <Text mark>original name of Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him)</Text> and his role as a <Text mark>miraculous healer</Text>, as supported by <Text strong>biblical texts</Text> and <Text italic>linguistic evidence</Text>. Jesus’ name was <Text mark>Esa</Text>, a name rooted in Hebrew and connected to his Islamic identity, reflecting his mission as a <Text type="success">healer and messenger of Allah</Text>. Let’s uncover this profound truth through scripture, history, and language.

  <Title level={4}>1. 🕊️ Jesus’ Original Name: Esa, Not Iesu</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
  Prophet Jesus’ original name was <Text mark>Esa</Text>, as it is in Islam. In Latin, his name is <Text code>Iesu</Text>, and in Greek, it is <Text code>Iesus</Text>. However, there is substantial evidence that Jesus spoke and preached in <Text strong>Arabic</Text>, alongside other languages, in Palestine during his time. While Greek was popular, Arabic was also widely used, and the name <Text mark>Esa</Text> aligns with this linguistic context.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Linguistic Evidence from Hebrew:</Text><br />
  In Hebrew, the name is <Text code>Asa (עָשָׂא)</Text>, pronounced as <Text italic>/ˈeɪsə/ or /ˈeɪzə/</Text>. This name means <Text mark>"healer" or "physician"</Text> (Ase). According to Wikipedia:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  "Asa is a given name in several parts of the world. In English, the usual pronunciation is /ˈeɪsə/ or /ˈeɪzə/... Asa (עָשָׂא): a Hebrew name meaning healer and/or physician (Ase)... Asa: a royal and kingly name, and it was the name of the third king of Judah, who reigned for forty years, became a popular American name because of the influence of the Puritans in the 17th century."
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  This confirms that <Text mark>Asa (Esa)</Text> is a Hebrew name meaning <Text type="success">"healer" or "physician"</Text>, directly reflecting Jesus’ role.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Connection to Islam:</Text><br />
  In the <Text code>Quran</Text>, Jesus is consistently referred to as <Text mark>Esa (عيسى)</Text>, aligning with the Hebrew <Text code>Asa</Text>. The Islamic name preserves the <Text strong>original meaning and pronunciation</Text>, unlike the Latin <Text code>Iesu</Text> or Greek <Text code>Iesus</Text>, which evolved over time. The use of <Text strong>Arabic in Palestine</Text> during Jesus’ era further supports that <Text mark>Esa</Text> was likely the name he was known by among his people.
</Paragraph>

<Text underline>
  <Title level={4}>2. 🩺 Jesus as a Miraculous Healer</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
  Jesus’ miracles were almost entirely <Text mark>medical</Text>, focusing on <Text type="success">healing the sick</Text>, which aligns with his name <Text mark>Esa (healer)</Text>. The Bible explicitly refers to him as a <Text strong>"doctor"</Text>:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  Luke 5:31: "Jesus answered them, ‘Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.’”<br />
  Matthew 9:12: "But when he heard it, he said, ‘Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.’”<br />
  Mark 2:17: "And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, ‘Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.’”
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  These verses confirm that <Text strong>Jesus identified himself as a "physician"</Text>, directly corresponding to the meaning of his name, <Text mark>Esa (healer)</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Evidence from the Quran:</Text><br />
  The <Text code>Quran</Text> also highlights Jesus’ <Text type="success">miraculous healing powers</Text>, affirming his role as a healer:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  Quran 19:30: "[Jesus] said, ‘Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.’”<br />
  Quran 5:75: "The Messiah, son of Mary, was but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him…”
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  While the Quran doesn’t use the term <Text code>"doctor"</Text>, it describes Jesus’ miracles, such as <Text mark>healing the blind and lepers</Text> and <Text mark>raising the dead</Text>, <Text italic>by Allah’s permission</Text> (<Text code>Quran 3:49</Text>), reinforcing his role as a <Text type="success">miraculous healer</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<hr />


<Text underline> <Title level={4}>3. 📜 Jesus as the Messiah in the Original Gospel</Title> </Text> <Paragraph> The most original Hebrew and Aramaic versions of Jesus’ Gospel, such as the <Text strong>Gospel of the Nazarenes</Text> (dated to around <Text mark>90–150 CE</Text>), refer to him as <Text mark>Esa</Text>. According to the Glorious Quran in <Text mark>Noble Verse 19:30</Text>, Jesus did not identify himself as a doctor by name at first. He later became known as the <Text italic>"healer"</Text> or <Text italic>"physician"</Text>, just as he later became the <Text strong>Messiah</Text> to the masses: </Paragraph> <Paragraph> <Text code>Quran 19:30</Text>: <Text italic>"[Jesus] said, ‘Indeed, I am the servant of Allah! He has appointed me His messenger, and granted me the gospel!’"</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> The Messiah, son of Maryam, was an <Text strong>apostle</Text>. Because of his <Text type="success">miraculous healing powers</Text>, he became known as <Text mark>Esa (healer)</Text> and also as the <Text strong>king of the Jews</Text>, as supported by: </Paragraph> <Paragraph> <Text code>Luke 5:31</Text>, <Text code>Matthew 9:12</Text>, and <Text code>Mark 2:17</Text> (as cited above), where Jesus calls himself a physician. The Jews pronounced his name as <Text mark>Esa (עָשָׂא)</Text>, reflecting the Hebrew meaning of <Text italic>healer</Text>. </Paragraph> <hr /> <Text underline> <Title level={4}>4. 🌟 Jesus: A Miraculous Esa in the New Testament</Title> </Text> <Paragraph> Jesus healed thousands in the New Testament, solidifying his role as a <Text mark>miraculous Esa (healer)</Text>. His miracles, such as <Text type="success">healing the blind, curing lepers, and raising the dead</Text>, are well-documented: </Paragraph> <Paragraph> <Text code>Matthew 9:35</Text>: <Text italic>"And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages… healing every disease and every affliction."</Text> <Text code>Luke 7:22</Text>: <Text italic>"…the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear…"</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> These acts of healing directly align with the meaning of his name, <Text mark>Esa</Text>, and confirm his identity as a <Text strong>miraculous physician</Text>. </Paragraph> <hr /> <Text underline> <Title level={4}>5. 🕋 Jesus’ Return as Esa</Title> </Text> <Paragraph> When Jesus returns, he will be recognized by his original name, <Text mark>Esa</Text>, as affirmed in Islamic tradition. This is supported by: </Paragraph> <Paragraph> <Text code>Wikipedia</Text>: <Text italic>"WILL JESUS BE BORN OF A VIRGIN WHEN HE RETURNS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asa_(given_name)"</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> In Islam, Jesus (<Text mark>Esa</Text>) will return as a <Text strong>just ruler</Text>, breaking the cross and affirming the <Text type="warning">true message of submission to Allah</Text> (<Text code>Sahih Muslim, Book 1, Hadith 287</Text>). His return under the name Esa further ties his identity to the <Text strong>Islamic understanding</Text> of his prophethood. </Paragraph> <hr /> <Text underline> <Title level={4}>6. 🌍 Historical Context: Early Christians and Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)</Title> </Text> <Paragraph> Early Christians in Rome <Text type="warning">preached about Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)</Text>, indicating a connection between the prophetic traditions. This historical note suggests that the message of <Text mark>Jesus (Esa)</Text> was part of a broader continuum of <Text strong>divine guidance</Text>, culminating in the prophethood of <Text strong>Muhammad (PBUH)</Text>. </Paragraph> <hr /> <Text underline> <Title level={4}>🌟 Conclusion: Esa, the Miraculous Healer and Messenger</Title> </Text> <Paragraph> Prophet Jesus’ original name was <Text mark>Esa (עָשָׂא)</Text>, meaning <Text italic>"healer"</Text> or <Text italic>"physician"</Text>, a name preserved in Islam and rooted in the <Text strong>Hebrew</Text> and <Text strong>Arabic</Text> languages of his time. His role as a <Text type="success">miraculous healer</Text> is evident in the New Testament (<Text code>Luke 5:31</Text>, <Text code>Matthew 9:12</Text>, <Text code>Mark 2:17</Text>) and the Quran (<Text code>19:30</Text>, <Text code>5:75</Text>), where he is celebrated for his <Text type="success">medical miracles</Text> and his <Text strong>prophethood</Text>. The original Gospel texts, such as the <Text strong>Gospel of the Nazarenes</Text>, confirm his name as Esa, aligning with the Islamic tradition that he will return under this name. Jesus (<Text mark>Esa</Text>) was a <Text strong>servant of Allah</Text>, a <Text strong>healer of the sick</Text>, and a <Text strong>messenger to humanity</Text>, calling all to the <Text type="warning">path of submission</Text>. </Paragraph> <Paragraph> <Text strong>Key Verses for Reflection:</Text> <br /> <Text code>Luke 5:31, Matthew 9:12, Mark 2:17</Text>: Jesus identifies as a physician. <br /> <Text code>Quran 19:30</Text>: Jesus declares himself a servant and messenger of Allah. <br /> <Text code>Quran 5:75</Text>: Jesus, the Messiah, is an apostle of Allah. </Paragraph> <Paragraph> Let us honor <Text strong>Prophet Esa (peace be upon him)</Text> by recognizing his <Text mark>true name and mission</Text>, and following the <Text type="warning">path of submission to Allah</Text>. 🌟 </Paragraph> <hr />
