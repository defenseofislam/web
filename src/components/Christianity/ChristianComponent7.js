       <Text underline><Title level={4}>1. The Absence of Two Essences in Jesus’ Biblical Teachings</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text mark>The Christian doctrine that Jesus possesses two essences—fully divine and fully human—is central to the concepts of the Trinity and the atonement.</Text> 
  <Text italic>{" "}However, a careful examination of the Bible reveals that Jesus never explicitly claims to have two essences.</Text> 
  <Text code>This absence shows that the idea is a product of later church teachings rather than the words of Jesus himself.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>In the New Testament, Jesus makes statements about his identity, but none clearly affirm a dual nature.</Text> For instance:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In John 10:30, Jesus says, <Text underline>"I and the Father are one."</Text> 
 {" "} While some interpret this as a claim to divinity, the context in John 17:21-22, where Jesus prays for his disciples to be <Text italic>"one, as we are one,"</Text> 
  suggests <Text type="warning">unity in purpose</Text>, not a dual essence.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In Mark 10:18, when addressed as "good teacher," Jesus responds, {" "}
  <Text underline>"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone,"</Text> 
  {" "}distancing himself from <Text type="danger">divine attributes</Text> in this instance.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In John 14:28, Jesus states, <Text underline>"The Father is greater than I,"</Text> 
  {" "}which complicates claims of <Text strong>equal divinity</Text> or a dual nature.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  The concept of Jesus having two natures, known as the hypostatic union, was formalized at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE, long after Jesus’ time.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>This doctrine emerged from theological debates, not from explicit biblical texts.</Text> 
  <Text type="success">The Bible’s silence on Jesus claiming two essences indicates that this is a church construct, not a teaching rooted in scripture.</Text>
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <Text mark>One of the most powerful biblical affirmations of God’s oneness</Text>{" "}
  comes directly from Jesus in{" "}
  <Text code>Mark 12:29</Text>, where he proclaims:{" "}
  <Text underline>"The most important [commandment] is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.’"</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>This declaration is unambiguous</Text>{" "}
  and reflects the monotheistic message at the heart of Jesus' mission.{" "}
  <Text type="danger">Nowhere does Jesus hint at a dual nature within himself</Text>{" "}
  or promote the idea of co-equality with God in essence.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Another foundational statement comes from John 17:3,</Text>{" "}
  where Jesus addresses God directly:{" "}
  <Text code>"This is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent."</Text>{" "}
  <Text type="success">In this clear distinction, Jesus identifies himself as the one who is sent</Text>{" "}
  and God as{" "}
  <Text mark>“the only true God.”</Text>{" "}
  <Text type="warning">There is no indication of shared divinity or essence.</Text>{" "}
  Instead, Jesus separates his own role from that of the divine Being he worships.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  These verses make it evident that the concept of Jesus having two essences—both divine and human—has no explicit support in the teachings of Jesus himself.
</Paragraph>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>2. Implications for the Trinity and Atonement</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text mark>The absence of a clear biblical basis for Jesus’ dual nature</Text>{" "}
  <Text type="danger">undermines two core Christian doctrines:</Text>{" "}
  <Text strong>the Trinity and the atonement.</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>The Trinity relies on Jesus being fully divine and co-equal with the Father,</Text>{" "}
  yet verses like John 5:30{" "}
  <Text underline>("I can do nothing on my own")</Text>{" "}and Matthew 24:36{" "}
  <Text underline>("But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father")</Text>{" "}
  suggest <Text type="warning">limitations inconsistent with full divinity.</Text>{" "}
  Without a scriptural foundation for two essences,{" "}
  <Text type="success">the Trinitarian claim that Jesus is the second person of a triune God falters.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Similarly, <Text strong>the atonement</Text>—the belief that Jesus’ death paid for humanity’s sins—depends on{" "}
  <Text type="danger">his divine nature to give the sacrifice infinite value.</Text>{" "}
  However, if Jesus has two essences,{" "}
  <Text italic>the question of who died on the cross creates a theological dilemma,</Text>{" "}
  as the challenge below articulates.{" "}
  <Text code>This contradiction highlights the fragility of doctrines built on the two-essences concept,</Text>{" "}
  <Paragraph type="secondary" italic>which lacks direct support from Jesus’ words.</Paragraph>
</Paragraph>

<Text underline>
  <Title level={4}>3. A Challenge to Christians</Title>
</Text>
<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Here is a direct challenge to those who believe Jesus is God,</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>presented humbly but firmly,</Text>{" "}
  to provoke reflection on the{" "}
  <Text type="warning">logical and scriptural issues of the two-essences doctrine:</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>A simple question to every Christian who believes Jesus is God:</Text>{" "}
  <Text mark>Do you believe Jesus died on the cross?</Text>{" "}
  If your answer is yes, then you're literally saying{" "}
  <Text type="danger">"God died"</Text>—and that's{" "}
  <Text underline>blasphemy</Text> even by your own standards, because{" "}
  <Text strong>God is eternal, unchanging, and cannot die, suffer, or be humiliated.</Text>{" "}
  But if you say only the{" "}
  <Text italic>"human body"</Text>{" "}died and not the divine nature, then{" "}
  <Text type="success">the one who died wasn't God—it was just a human.</Text>{" "}
  And that{" "}
  <Text type="danger">destroys the entire foundation of the so-called "atonement,"</Text>{" "}
  because a human death has no eternal or divine value.{" "}
  <Text mark>A finite man cannot bear the sins of billions.</Text>{" "}
  So you're stuck between two{" "}
  <Text type="warning">impossible options:</Text>{" "}
  either God died,{" "}
  <Text italic>which is a contradiction and blasphemy,</Text>{" "}
  or a man died, which makes your doctrine of salvation worthless.{" "}
  <Text underline>Don't say "only the human side died"</Text>—because then{" "}
  <Text type="danger">why call him God?</Text>{" "}
  Why claim his death saved humanity?{" "}
  If it was the human side only, then{" "}
  <Text strong>your God didn't sacrifice anything.</Text>{" "}
  The divine nature remained untouched.{" "}
  <Text code>So where's the sacrifice?</Text>{" "}
  And if it was the divine nature that died—then you believe in a{" "}
  <Text type="danger">dead God.</Text>{" "}
  <Text mark>That's pure heresy.</Text>{" "}
  Saying{" "}
  <Text italic>"it's a mystery"</Text>{" "}
  is not a real answer.{" "}
  <Text type="warning">It's just an escape.</Text>{" "}
  Real faith is not built on contradictions.{" "}
  <Text underline>So I ask again: who died on the cross?</Text>{" "}
  A man?{" "}
  <Text type="success">Then your atonement is invalid.</Text>{" "}
  God?{" "}
  <Text type="danger">Then you believe God dies.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  Either way, your belief collapses.{" "}
  <Text code>Which will you choose: a dead God, or a meaningless crucifixion?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Text underline>
  <Title level={4}>4. The Islamic Perspective: Clarity and Simplicity</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="success">In contrast to the complexities and contradictions of the two-essences doctrine,</Text>{" "}
  <Text strong>Islam offers a clear, beautiful, and coherent understanding of God.</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>In Islam, God is One, Eternal, and Absolute,</Text>{" "}
  as described in Surah Al-Ikhlas (112:1-4):{" "}
  <Text underline>"Say, He is Allah, the One; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He neither begets nor is begotten; Nor is there to Him any equivalent."</Text>{" "}
  This portrayal of God is{" "}
  <Text mark>simple yet profound:</Text>{" "}
  He is beyond human limitations, never becomes flesh, never dies, and never requires a sacrifice to express His mercy.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In Islam,{" "}
  <Text strong>forgiveness is a divine act of grace and justice.</Text>{" "}
  <Text type="danger">God forgives those who sincerely repent,</Text>{" "}
  without the need for a blood sacrifice or a complex mechanism of atonement.{" "}
  The Qur’an states in Surah Az-Zumar (39:53):{" "}
  <Text code>"Say, ‘O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.’"</Text>{" "}
  <Text type="warning">This mercy is direct and accessible,</Text>{" "}
  reflecting a God who is compassionate and just, not bound by human constructs of sacrifice or incarnation.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  <Text mark>Islam views Jesus (peace be upon him) as a noble prophet,</Text>{" "}
  a servant of God, and a messenger who called people to worship the One True God.{" "}
  He is honored and revered,{" "}
  <Text type="danger">but not divine.</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>This perspective avoids the contradictions</Text>{" "}
  of a dual nature or a triune God, offering a{" "}
  <Text strong>faith that is rational, consistent, and deeply spiritual.</Text>
</Paragraph>



<hr />

<Text underline>
  <Title level={4}> Conclusion</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>With humility, we invite reflection on the challenge posed above.</Text>{" "}
  <Text type="danger">The doctrine of Jesus’ two essences,</Text>{" "}
  <Text strong>central to the Trinity and atonement,</Text>{" "}
  lacks explicit support in the Bible and{" "}
  <Text type="warning">leads to logical inconsistencies.</Text>{" "}
  <Text mark>Islam, in contrast, provides a clear and beautiful understanding of God</Text>{" "}
  as{" "}
  <Text underline>One, Eternal, and Merciful,</Text>{" "}
  who forgives without the need for{" "}
  <Text code>sacrifice or incarnation.</Text>{" "}
  <Text type="success">We ask with sincerity:</Text>{" "}
  can a faith built on contradictions bring peace to the heart?{" "}
  Or does the{" "}
  <Text strong>simplicity of God’s oneness,</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>as taught in Islam,</Text>{" "}
  offer the clarity and truth that humanity seeks?
