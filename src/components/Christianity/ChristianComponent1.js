Introduction: The Shaky Foundation Beneath Christianity

</Title>

<Paragraph>
  Let’s not sugarcoat it—<Text strong>Christianity stands on two fragile pillars: the Trinity and the Crucifixion</Text>. Knock those down, and the entire religion collapses like a paper house in a storm. Yet, these two beliefs are exactly what millions blindly accept without question, often shouting <Text code>"faith!"</Text> whenever logic starts pressing too hard.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But here’s the truth:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="danger">The Trinity</Text> is <Text italic>a manmade theological maze</Text>, <Text type="danger">a contradiction dressed in mystery</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="danger">The Crucifixion</Text> is <Text type="warning">a moral disaster</Text>, where injustice is painted as <Text strong>divine mercy</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Worse yet, <Text type="warning">Christian trolls</Text> run around mocking Muslims—<Text type="danger">accusing us of worshipping out of fear, denying salvation, and not “knowing” Jesus</Text>—while they cling to a religion that has <Text strong>God dying on a cross</Text> and <Text underline>calling Himself His own son</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  This article is not for the weak-hearted.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  It’s for those who <Text strong>dare to question</Text>, who refuse to be <Text type="danger">spoon-fed contradictions</Text>, and who crave truth without compromise.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  So let’s <Text mark>tear off the mask</Text> and expose the <Text type="danger">broken core of Christian theology</Text>—<Text code>no mercy, no filters, no apologies</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="danger">Let the theological massacre begin.</Text>
</Paragraph>





<hr />

<Text underline><Title level={4}>1. Trinity: A Divine Puzzle That No One Understands (Not Even Christians)
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Let’s be <Text strong>brutally honest</Text>—<Text type="danger">the Trinity is a theological headache</Text>. One God, but three persons? Father, Son, Holy Spirit—<Text italic>all equally God</Text>, but not three gods? Not one person? Not three separate gods, but not one person either? <Text code>What?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Even top Christian scholars will admit:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  “It’s a mystery. Just believe it.”
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Sorry, that doesn’t cut it.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>God isn’t a puzzle box.</Text> He created our minds to <Text strong>think, reflect, and submit to truth</Text>—not to blindly nod at contradictions. Christianity wants you to believe that <Text strong>Jesus is God</Text>, but also prayed to God, cried to God, submitted to God, and even said:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  “The Father is greater than I.” (John 14:28)<br/>
  “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46)<br/>
  “The only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.” (John 17:3)
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Jesus made a clear distinction.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>God is someone other than him.</Text><br/>
  <Text code>God is greater than him.</Text><br/>
  <Text code>God sent him.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="danger">Game over.</Text> If he was God, who was he praying to? <Text code>Himself?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Even logic shouts:<br/>
  <Text mark>God is not dependent, not born, not crying in a manger, not sweating blood.</Text><br/>
  You can't say <Text strong>God is unchanging and eternal</Text>—and also say He became a man who grew up, got tired, bled, and died.
</Paragraph>





<Text underline><Title level={4}>2. God Dying? That’s Not Divine. That’s Absurd.
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  According to Christianity, the <Text strong>creator of the universe</Text> decided to become human and… <Text type="danger">get crucified by his own creation?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Let’s break it down like this:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>God is perfect.</Text><br/>
  <Text type="danger">Humans are sinful.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  To “save” humanity, God comes down in flesh (<Text strong>Jesus</Text>), and gets <Text type="warning">tortured</Text>, <Text type="warning">humiliated</Text>, <Text type="warning">spat on</Text>, and <Text type="danger">nailed to a cross</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>That’s not divine mercy.</Text> <Text type="danger">That’s divine helplessness.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  What kind of “savior” gets arrested, beaten, and cries <Text italic>“Eli Eli, why have you forsaken me?”</Text><br/>
  Is this the Almighty, or a <Text mark>man crushed by Roman soldiers</Text>?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="danger">You call that salvation?</Text><br/>
  <Text type="success">We call that injustice.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Why would an innocent man suffer for the crimes of the guilty?<br/>
  Would you accept it if a judge today said, <Text code>“Let this criminal go free—we’ll punish an innocent child instead”</Text>?<br/>
  You’d call that judge <Text type="danger">insane</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But somehow, Christianity calls that judge <Text type="danger">“God.”</Text>
</Paragraph>

3. Jesus: Cursed in Christianity, Honored in Islam


</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Christian theology says:</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.” (Galatians 3:13)
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  So… <Text type="danger">Jesus became a curse?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  They try to explain:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  “No no, he just took the curse on himself for our sake.”
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Stop.</Text> <Text type="danger">That’s not noble. That’s twisted.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  You’re saying <Text mark>God’s most beloved servant was turned into a curse</Text>?<br/>
  You’re saying the <Text strong>Messiah</Text>, born <Text italic>pure and sinless</Text>, was cursed because people thousands of years later would sin?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Islam says:</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  “Indeed, he was honored in this world and the hereafter. He is among those brought near to Allah.” (Qur’an 3:45)
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="success">We don’t humiliate the Messiah.</Text><br/>
  <Text type="success">We don’t strip him naked and hang him between criminals.</Text><br/>
  <Text type="success">We don’t call him cursed.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>We call him:</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>Ruhullah (Spirit from Allah)</Text><br/>
  <Text code>Kalimatullah (Word of Allah)</Text><br/>
  <Text code>Isa Ibn Maryam (Jesus, son of Mary)</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="danger">Christianity crucifies Jesus physically.</Text><br/>
  <Text type="danger">Christian theology crucifies him spiritually.</Text><br/>
  <Text type="success">Islam honors him entirely.</Text>
</Paragraph>







<Text underline><Title level={4}>
4. “He Took the Sins of the World” — Or So They Claim



</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  One of the most <Text type="danger">bizarre</Text> Christian ideas is that:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  “Jesus died for your sins, so you’re saved.”
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Let’s test that logic.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  If I <Text type="warning">steal</Text>, <Text type="warning">kill</Text>, and <Text type="warning">commit evil</Text>—but I believe Jesus died for me, I go to <Text type="success">Heaven</Text>.<br/>
  But a <Text strong>kind, sincere soul</Text> who worships God but doesn’t accept that Jesus died for him goes to <Text type="danger">Hell</Text>?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  That’s not mercy.<br/>
  <Text type="danger">That’s moral blackmail.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And why should someone else be punished for your mistakes?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>You sin.</Text><br/>
  <Text code>He suffers.</Text><br/>
  <Text code>You get Paradise.</Text><br/>
  <Text code>He gets a cross.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  That’s not <Text strong>justice</Text>. <Text type="danger">That’s a cosmic scam.</Text>
</Paragraph>







<Text underline><Title level={4}>5. Islam’s View: Pure, Logical, Unbreakable


</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Islam says:</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  “God is One. Not three. Not divided.”
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text mark>God doesn’t become man.</Text> He <Text strong>sends prophets</Text>, not Himself.<br/>
  <Text strong>Everyone is responsible</Text> for their own actions.<br/>
  <Text type="success">No one bears the sin of another.</Text><br/>
  <Text code>Salvation = Faith + Action + God’s Mercy</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Islam gives you a direct line to God.</Text><br/>
  <Text type="danger">No dead man on a stick.</Text><br/>
  <Text type="danger">No divine suicide.</Text><br/>
  <Text type="danger">No blood sacrifice.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Just <Text code>pure tawheed</Text>. <Text type="success">Absolute justice.</Text> <Text type="success">Absolute mercy.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  You don’t need a mediator.<br/>
  You don’t need to believe God died to forgive you.<br/>
  <Text mark>You just need to turn to Him sincerely.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>Pray directly. Repent directly. Worship directly.</Text><br/>
  <Text type="success">Your soul. Your deeds. Your accountability.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And the reward? <Text type="success">Jannah (Paradise)</Text>—<Text italic>not bought by blood</Text>, but earned through sincere faith, righteous effort, and divine grace.
</Paragraph>






<Text underline><Title level={4}>
Conclusion: Christianity’s Core is a House of Cards


</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  At its core, <Text strong>Christianity says:</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>God became man.</Text><br/>
  <Text code>He died.</Text><br/>
  <Text code>He took your sins.</Text><br/>
  <Text code>Believe in that, and you’re saved.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="danger">Sorry</Text>—but the <Text strong>One True God</Text> <Text type="danger">doesn’t die</Text>, <Text type="danger">doesn’t get cursed</Text>, and <Text type="danger">doesn’t base forgiveness on blood rituals</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="danger">Christianity is built on confusion, contradictions, and emotional blackmail.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="success">Islam is built on clarity, logic, and unshakable truth.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  You want to know the <Text strong>real Messiah</Text>?<br/>
  Look to the one who <Text type="success">never sinned</Text>, <Text type="success">never claimed to be God</Text>, and <Text type="success">never asked for worship</Text>—<Text code>Jesus (peace be upon him), the Prophet of Allah</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="danger">Trinity?</Text> <Text strong>Crushed.</Text><br/>
  <Text type="danger">Crucifixion?</Text> <Text strong>Debunked.</Text><br/>
  <Text type="danger">Christian trolls?</Text> <Text strong>K.O.</Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text mark>Come back when you’re ready for real monotheism.</Text>
