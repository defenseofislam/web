        <Text underline><Title level={2}>JESUS WAS A MUSLIM — NOT A CHRISTIAN, NOT A JEW

(In the Light of Christian and Islamic Theology)
</Title></Text>

       <Text underline><Title level={4}>Introduction: Who Really Was Jesus?</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
 <Text strong>Let’s settle this once and for all:</Text>{" "}
<Text mark>Jesus (peace be upon him) was a Muslim.</Text>{" "}
He did not preach Christianity. He did not teach the Trinity. He did not call himself God.{" "}
<Text underline>He submitted his will to Allah.</Text>{" "}
And that, by definition, is <Text type="success">Islam</Text>.{" "}

Even in the Christian Bible, <Text warning>Jesus never said, “I am God.”</Text>{" "}
He never said, <Text code>“Worship me.”</Text>{" "}
He never founded a church.{" "}
<Text type="danger">And he never used the word Christianity.</Text>{" "}
Neither he identified himself as a <Text type="danger">"christian"</Text> or a <Text type="danger">"jew"</Text>  by belief!{" "}
So what was he really? What belief did he had?{" "}
Was he a polytheist, atheist, agnostic, jew or christian??{" "}
Or was he a <Text italic>Muslim</Text>??{" "}

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
Let’s tear off the <Text type="danger">fabricated</Text>  church doctrine and look at the <Text type="success">Original Jesus</Text>  — the man who worshipped the <Text strong>One True God</Text> , prostrated to Him, and called people to righteousness, not to his blood.
</Paragraph>
</Paragraph>



<hr />

<Text underline><Title level={4}>1. What Does “Muslim” Mean? Jesus Fit the Definition Perfectly</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
A <Text strong>Muslim</Text> is anyone who submits his or her will to the <Text type="success">One True God — Allah</Text> — without associating partners.{" "}

And what did Jesus say?

<Text code>📖 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.” (Matthew 7:21)</Text>{" "}

🔎 <Text underline>Doing the will of God = Islam</Text>{" "}
That’s exactly what <Text warning>Islam means:</Text>{" "}
<Text mark>submission to the will of Allah</Text>.{" "}

<Text italic>Jesus didn’t teach people to worship him. He taught people to obey God.</Text> That’s what Muslims do.{" "}

So let’s be honest — based on his own words,{" "}
<Text type="danger">Jesus was neither a Christian nor a Jew.</Text>{" "}
He was a <Text underline> <Text type="success">Muslim</Text></Text>.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
Truth is clear when one sincerely looks at the words, not the doctrines built around them.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Also According to the <Text strong>Qur'an</Text>, specifically in <Text mark>Surah Al-Ma'idah, verses 116-117</Text>, Allah will ask <Text type="success">Jesus, son of Mary</Text>, on the Day of Judgment:{" "}
<Text code>"Did you say unto men: 'Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?'"</Text>.{" "}
Jesus will respond, <Text underline>"Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it."</Text>.{" "}

This verse is interpreted as a <Text warning>denial by Jesus</Text> of being worshipped or of having asked people to worship him and his mother, as a deity beside Allah.{" "}

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
Even on the Day of Judgment, the message remains clear: Jesus called to the worship of Allah alone.
</Paragraph>
</Paragraph>





<hr />

<Text underline>
  <Title level={4}>2. Jesus Never Preached Christianity — Paul Did</Title>
</Text>
<Paragraph>
The word <Text strong>"Christianity"</Text> didn’t even exist during Jesus’ life.{" "}
Jesus never used it. His followers never called themselves Christians while he was alive.{" "}

In fact:{" "}

<Text code>📖 “The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.” (Acts 11:26)</Text>{" "}

That’s after Jesus had already left the earth.{" "}

So who brought this new religion? <Text type="danger">Paul</Text>.{" "}
A man who never met Jesus in his lifetime, who flipped Jesus’ message upside-down by:{" "}

<Text warning>Claiming salvation through crucifixion</Text>{" "}
Promoting <Text italic>Trinity</Text>{" "}
Cancelling the <Text underline>Law (Torah)</Text> that Jesus himself followed{" "}
Turning the Prophet into a god{" "}

Ask yourself:{" "}
Would Jesus — who was circumcised, followed the Sabbath, didn’t eat pork, and prayed to God — accept being worshipped as God?{" "}
<Text type="success">Absolutely not.</Text>{" "}
<Text mark>We should rename Christianity as Paulinity</Text> as it was preached By <Text type="danger">Paul</Text>, not <Text type="success">Christ</Text>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
Sometimes the clearest truths are the ones history tried hardest to blur.
</Paragraph>



<hr />


<Text underline>
  <Title level={4}>3. Jesus Worshipped God, Prayed Like Muslims, Not Christians or Jews</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
<Text code>📖 “He fell with his face to the ground and prayed.” (Matthew 26:39)</Text>{" "}

That’s <Text underline>sujood (prostration)</Text> — the same way <Text strong>Muslims pray</Text>.{" "}
Christians today fold hands and chant in choirs.{" "}
<Text mark>Jesus placed his forehead on the ground</Text>, like every Muslim on Earth does today. Why?{" "}
Because he worshipped the same God we worship: <Text type="success">Allah</Text>.{" "}

He fasted. He said <Text italic>“Peace be upon you.”</Text> He gave charity.{" "}
He promoted modesty and obeying commandments.{" "}

Not once did he say <Text warning>“I’m part of a Trinity.”</Text>{" "}
Not once did he say <Text danger>“I’m dying for your sins.”</Text>{" "}
Not once did he say <Text type="danger">“Worship me.”</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
The actions of Jesus reflect Islam far more than the doctrines invented after him.
</Paragraph>




<hr />

<Text underline>
  <Title level={4}>4. According to the Bible, Jesus Was a Servant of God — Not God</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
<Text code>📖 “The only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.” (John 17:3)</Text>{" "}

Even the Bible says:{" "}

<Text strong>God is ONE</Text>{" "}

<Text warning>Jesus is a messenger, not the source of divinity</Text>{" "}

<Text mark>Jesus called God “my God”</Text> — not “me.”{" "}
Even after resurrection, he said:{" "}

<Text code>📖 “I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.” (John 20:17)</Text>{" "}

How can <Text type="danger">God have a God</Text>?{" "}
This alone <Text underline>demolishes the idea that Jesus is divine</Text>.{" "}
This alone proves he was <Text type="success">submitting to a Higher Power</Text> — not acting as one.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
When taken at face value, Jesus’ own words dismantle man-made doctrines.
</Paragraph>




<hr />

<Text underline>
  <Title level={4}>5. The Qur’an Confirms Jesus Was a Muslim Prophet</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
<Text code>🕋 “Indeed, Jesus was no more than a servant of Allah, whom He favored with Prophethood.” (Qur’an 43:59)</Text>{" "}

<Text code>🕋 “He (Jesus) said, ‘Indeed, I am a servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.’” (Qur’an 19:30)</Text>{" "}

In Islam:{" "}

<Text strong>Jesus is a prophet, not a god</Text>{" "}

He was born <Text type="success">miraculously, without a father</Text>{" "}

He never died on a cross — <Text warning>Allah raised him</Text>{" "}

He will return at the End of Times to <Text underline>restore justice</Text>{" "}

<Text danger>No Trinity. No blood sacrifice. No confusion.</Text>{" "}

<Text mark>Just pure, undiluted monotheism.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
The truth of Jesus in Islam is simple, dignified, and uncompromised.
</Paragraph>





<hr />

<Text underline>
  <Title level={4}>6. Christianity Teaches Jesus Was Cursed — Islam Says He Was Blessed</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
<Text code>📖 “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us...” (Galatians 3:13)</Text>{" "}

<Text type="danger">WHAT?! They call Jesus cursed?</Text>{" "}

In Islam, <Text strong>Jesus (peace be upon him) is blessed</Text>:{" "}

<Text code>🕋 “And He has made me blessed wherever I may be…” (Qur’an 19:31)</Text>{" "}

How can someone be both <Text mark>cursed and divine</Text>?{" "}
How can a <Text underline>sinless prophet of God</Text> become a sacrifice soaked in sin?{" "}

The truth is:{" "}
<Text warning>Christianity slanders Jesus</Text> by making him a human shield for sin.{" "}
<Text type="success">Islam honors him as a noble, innocent Prophet of God</Text> — never humiliated, never tortured, never made divine.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
The choice is clear: defamation or dignity, confusion or clarity.
</Paragraph>






<hr />

<Text underline>
  <Title level={4}>Conclusion: Let’s Call Him By His True Identity — A Muslim</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
So who was Jesus really?{" "}

A man who submitted to One God ➤ <Text strong>Muslim</Text>{" "}

A man who obeyed God’s law ➤ <Text type="success">Muslim</Text>{" "}

A man who never claimed to be divine ➤ <Text warning>Muslim</Text>{" "}

A man who prayed in <Text underline>sujood</Text> ➤ Muslim{" "}

A prophet who never heard the word “Christianity” ➤ <Text mark>Muslim</Text>{" "}

He never said <Text type="danger">"I am God."</Text>{" "}
He never said <Text danger>"Worship me."</Text>{" "}
He never said <Text italic>"I died for your sins."</Text>{" "}

<Text warning>Christianity buried the real Jesus under layers of mythology and Paul’s corruption.</Text>{" "}
But <Text strong>Islam resurrects the real image of Jesus</Text>:{" "}

A man of truth. A prophet of Allah. A <Text type="success">Muslim</Text>.{" "}

And to the trolls still denying it?{" "}

<Text underline>You’re not rejecting Islam.</Text>{" "}
<Text danger>You’re rejecting Jesus.</Text>{" "}

And one day, <Text mark>Jesus himself will reject you.</Text>{" "}
(According to Matthew 7:22-23){" "}

<Text code>💥 K.O.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
In the end, truth stands clear from falsehood — and Jesus will testify to it.
</Paragraph>
