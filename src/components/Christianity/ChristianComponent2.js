<Text underline><Title level={4}>1. The Pharaoh and the King</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Open any Bible.</Text><br/>
  The ruler of Joseph’s time is called <Text italic>*Pharaoh*</Text>.<br/>
  The ruler of Moses’ time? Also <Text italic>*Pharaoh*</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But the <Text mark>Qur’an</Text> — without access to any Egyptian record — gets it <Text type="success">exactly right</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In the story of <Text italic>*Joseph*</Text>, it calls the ruler:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“The King”* — <Text code>Malik</Text><br/>
  (Qur’an 12:43)
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Because modern Egyptology confirms:<br/>
  The title <Text code>“Pharaoh”</Text> was <Text type="danger">not yet used</Text> during Joseph’s time. It only became a royal title during the <Text italic>18th Dynasty (around 1500 BCE)</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Joseph is believed to have lived during the <Text strong>Hyksos period</Text>, when Egypt was ruled by foreign Semitic kings called <Text code>Heqa-Khasut</Text> ("rulers of foreign lands") — <Text delete>not “Pharaohs.”</Text><br/>
  <Text type="success">The Qur’an aligns with this perfectly.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text underline>Source:</Text><br/>
  <Text italic>* “Pharaoh: The History of Egypt’s Rulers from the Early Dynastic Period to the Greco-Roman Era,” by Joyce Tyldesley</Text><br/>
  <Text italic>* Egyptological consensus (Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt)</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And when we get to <Text italic>*Moses*</Text>, the Qur’an uses <Text code>"Pharaoh"</Text> (<Text code>Fir‘awn</Text>) again and again — as it became the official title during his time under <Text strong>Ramses II</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  This level of <Text type="warning">historical precision</Text> — <Text italic>not known at the time</Text>, and even <Text delete>contradicted by the Bible</Text> — is <Text mark>nothing short of extraordinary</Text>.

<Text underline><Title level={4}>2. Secular “Goodness” is Plagiarized from Religion
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Modern atheists grew up in societies heavily shaped by <Text strong>Judeo-Islamic values</Text>. Their sense of <Text italic>justice</Text>, <Text italic>charity</Text>, <Text italic>equality</Text>, and <Text italic>compassion</Text> are not secular inventions—they're <Text underline>religious inheritances</Text>, echoing centuries of divine command and prophetic example.

  <br /><br />
  Strip away the historical influence of religion, and you don’t get a <Text code>“moral atheist society”</Text>—you get a <Text type="warning">cold, utilitarian, godless wasteland</Text>. Ask the <Text type="danger">Soviet Union</Text>. Ask <Text type="danger">Maoist China</Text>. Ask <Text type="danger">Pol Pot's Cambodia</Text>. Tens of millions were <Text type="danger">slaughtered</Text> in the name of secular ideology.

  <br /><br />
  These regimes didn’t kill because they misunderstood atheism.  
  They killed because they understood atheism perfectly:<br />
  <Text type="danger">No God. No soul. No afterlife. No ultimate accountability.</Text><br />
  Just a <Text code>meat machine</Text> called “human” with no more value than a cockroach.

  <br /><br />
  <Text italic>When you erase the sacred, the human becomes disposable.</Text><br />
  <Text italic>When you deny transcendence, power becomes the only truth.</Text><br />
  <Text italic>Without God, morality is just politics.</Text> And in politics, <Text strong>the strongest fist writes the rules</Text>.

  <br /><br />
  The irony? Atheists enjoy moral vocabulary—<Text code>“rights”</Text>, <Text code>“dignity”</Text>, <Text code>“freedom”</Text>—that their own worldview <Text underline>cannot justify</Text>. They live off the <Text strong>moral capital</Text> of the very religion they reject, like <Text italic>spoiled heirs</Text> mocking the ancestor who built their house.

  <br /><br />
  <Text strong>Atheism didn’t build the conscience—it borrowed it.</Text>  
  {" "}And like all theft, <Text type="warning">it comes with a bill.</Text>
</Paragraph>







<Text underline><Title level={4}>
3. “We Can Be Good Without God” – Good According to What?

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  When an atheist says <Text code>“be good”</Text>, ask a simple but devastating question: <Text strong>“Define good.”</Text>

  <br /><br />
  Is <Text italic>“good”</Text> what benefits the most people?<br />
  Then would you <Text type="danger">harvest organs</Text> from one healthy man to save five sick patients? Welcome to utilitarian horror.

  <br /><br />
  Is <Text italic>“good”</Text> what makes people happy?<br />
  Then <Text code>drugs</Text>, <Text code>adultery</Text>, <Text code>porn</Text>, and <Text code>theft</Text> become “moral” as long as no one complains. Pleasure becomes the god, and dignity becomes the casualty.

  <br /><br />
  Is <Text italic>“good”</Text> just “not harming others”?<br />
  Then <Text type="warning">abortion</Text> is immoral. <Text italic>Oh wait—</Text>you don’t want to go there, do you?

  <br /><br />
  The uncomfortable truth is this: <Text strong>Atheists have no objective definition of good.</Text><br />
  Their “morality” is:

  <ul>
    <li><Text type="secondary">Situational</Text></li>
    <li><Text type="secondary">Fluid</Text></li>
    <li><Text type="secondary">Culturally bound</Text></li>
    <li><Text type="secondary">Vulnerable to revision</Text> every time society changes mood</li>
  </ul>

  <Text italic>“Good”</Text> becomes whatever the latest trending hashtag says it is.<br />
  Yesterday’s truth becomes today’s “phobia.”<br />
  Virtue is now just <Text type="warning">a costume worn for likes and applause</Text>.

  <br /><br />
  So don’t be fooled by their posturing. Their moral compass is not grounded in reality—it’s a <Text strong>weather vane</Text> spinning in cultural winds, not a <Text underline>foundation</Text> rooted in eternal truth.

  <br /><br />
  <Text strong>Without God, there is no “ought.”</Text><br />
  There’s only <Text code>“I feel like”</Text>—and that’s not morality. That’s mood with a microphone.
</Paragraph>






<Text underline><Title level={4}>
4. If Morality Can Exist Without Religion, Why Is the World Morally Collapsing the More It Becomes Secular?


</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  As the world <Text strong>abandons religion</Text>, take a look at the spiritual wreckage left behind:

  <ul>
    <li><Text type="danger">Families</Text> are <Text italic>breaking down</Text>.</li>
    <li><Text type="danger">Porn addiction</Text> is <Text italic>skyrocketing</Text>.</li>
    <li><Text type="danger">Suicide rates</Text> are <Text italic>exploding</Text>.</li>
    <li><Text type="danger">Depression</Text> is now <Text italic>rampant</Text>.</li>
    <li><Text type="danger">Gender confusion</Text> is being <Text underline>institutionalized</Text>.</li>
    <li><Text type="danger">Child grooming</Text> is defended in the name of <Text code>“inclusivity”</Text>.</li>
  </ul>

  <br />
  <Text strong>This is not a coincidence.</Text><br />
  <Text underline>This is the fruit of godless morality.</Text><br />
  A world without divine boundaries becomes a playground for every delusion, every desire, every darkness.

  <br /><br />
  <Text strong>Atheist ethics in action:</Text><br />
  <Text code>“Consent is king.”</Text><br />
  <Text code>“Truth is subjective.”</Text><br />
  <Text code>“Do whatever makes you happy.”</Text>

  <br /><br />
  But when chaos erupts—when children are mutilated in hospitals, when predators claim “identity,” when violence spills into the streets—suddenly, they pretend to be shocked.<br />
  <Text type="warning">But this is the world they created.</Text>

  <br /><br />
  You cannot build civilization on <Text code>feelings</Text> and <Text code>hashtags</Text>.<br />
  You cannot raise generations on <Text type="warning">moral relativism</Text> and expect stability.

  <br /><br />
  <Text strong>You can’t build a moral society on sand.</Text><br />
  You need rock. You need Revelation. You need God.
</Paragraph>






<Text underline><Title level={4}>5. Without Divine Judgment, Morality is Just a Game of Optics


</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  Ask an atheist this:<br />
  <Text strong>“If someone could commit the perfect crime—no consequences, no guilt, no trace—would it still be wrong?”</Text><br /><br />
  
  Their answer <Text italic>depends entirely</Text> on emotion, upbringing, or fear of reputation. No objective anchor. No eternal standard.<br /><br />

  But a Muslim responds with conviction:<br />
  <Text mark>
    “Whether I am alone or in public, Allah sees me. I obey not because I fear humans, but because I fear my Lord.”
  </Text><br /><br />

  <Text strong>In Islam, morality is rooted in:</Text>
  <ul>
    <li><Text code>Taqwa</Text> – The awareness of Allah at all times.</li>
    <li><Text code>Accountability</Text> – Knowing every deed is recorded.</li>
    <li><Text code>Submission</Text> – To divine law, not societal trends.</li>
  </ul>

  <br />
  Islamic ethics are not based on:
  <ul>
    <li><Text type="warning">Mood</Text></li>
    <li><Text type="warning">Majority rule</Text></li>
    <li><Text type="warning">Legal loopholes</Text></li>
  </ul>

  <br />
  <Text underline strong>Taqwa</Text> means you lower your gaze when no one is watching.<br />
  You speak the truth even if it costs you friends.<br />
  You return what is not yours even when there’s no camera.<br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">Atheism offers no such shield.</Text> When convenience clashes with conscience, their system folds.<br />
  It's not moral conviction—it’s <Text italic>moral cosplay</Text>, worn proudly until tested, then quietly discarded.<br /><br />

  <Text strong underline>
    When morality depends on man, it bends with man.
  </Text><br />
  But when morality is from God, it is <Text type="success">unshakable</Text>, <Text type="success">timeless</Text>, and <Text type="success">pure.</Text>
</Paragraph>





<Text underline><Title level={4}>6. Secular “Ethics” Produces Monsters in Lab Coats

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  When morality is unmoored from God, even <Text strong>science</Text> becomes a weapon:<br /><br />

  <ul>
    <li><Text type="danger">Nazi doctors</Text> experimented on children in the name of “genetic advancement.”</li>
    <li>
      <Text type="danger">Planned Parenthood</Text> 
      <Tooltip title ="The Planned Parenthood Fetal Tissue Scandal (2015): Undercover videos released by the Center for Medical Progress showed senior officials casually discussing the sale of fetal tissue and body parts from aborted babies—over lunch and wine.">
        {" "}<Text underline>harvested fetal organs [click me]</Text>
      </Tooltip> while smiling for grants.
    </li>
    <li><Text type="warning">AI ethicists</Text> now justify replacing humans to “optimize progress.”</li>
    <li><Text type="warning">Transhumanists</Text> fantasize about rewriting human nature and editing morality itself.</li>
  </ul>

  <br />
  <Text mark>Science without God becomes a scalpel in the hands of a psychopath.</Text><br /><br />

  Because <Text code>science tells you how</Text>, but only <Text strong>religion tells you why</Text>.<br /><br />

  Islam doesn’t reject science—it <Text italic>tames</Text> it.<br />
  It says: <Text type="success">“Advance, but under the banner of mercy, justice, and accountability.”</Text><br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">No God = No Banner</Text><br />
  Just knives and data. Just machines without conscience. Just innovation without soul.<br /><br />

  <Text strong underline>Science is a gift. But without God, it becomes a curse wrapped in code.</Text>
</Paragraph>




<Text underline><Title level={4}>7. Islam: The Last Fortress of True Morality

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Islam is not “subjective.”</Text><br />
  It doesn't shift with trends.<br />
  It doesn’t bow to <Text type="warning">opinion polls</Text>, hashtags, or political correctness.<br />
  What is <Text type="danger">haram</Text> today was haram 1,400 years ago—and will remain haram tomorrow.<br /><br />

  Islam doesn’t whisper: <Text italic>“If it feels good, do it.”</Text><br />
  It proclaims: <Text type="success">“If it pleases Allah, do it.”</Text><br /><br />

  <Text underline>It’s not morality by mood—it’s morality by revelation.</Text><br /><br />

  The <Text strong>Islamic system</Text> isn’t built in ivory towers of theory. It’s lived, tested, and preserved across centuries. It:<br /><br />

  <ul>
    <li><Text type="success">Protects the family</Text>—not redefines it every decade</li>
    <li><Text type="info">Honors truth</Text>—even when it's unpopular</li>
    <li><Text type="warning">Restrains desires</Text>—so the soul is not enslaved by lust</li>
    <li><Text type="danger">Condemns oppression</Text>—whether by kings or commoners</li>
    <li><Text type="success">Demands justice</Text>—not just legal, but eternal</li>
    <li><Text mark>Upholds accountability beyond death</Text>—because no crime truly disappears</li>
  </ul>

  <br />
  This is not just “being good.”<br />
  <Text type="warning">This is moral clarity in a world addicted to confusion.</Text><br /><br />

  While secular morality asks, <Text italic>“What can I get away with?”</Text><br />
  Islam asks, <Text strong>“What will I answer for on the Day of Judgment?”</Text><br /><br />

  <Text underline>That’s not fear—it’s dignity.</Text><br />
  <Text strong>That’s not oppression—it’s discipline.</Text><br />
  <Text mark>That’s not blind faith—it’s Divine Guidance.</Text>
</Paragraph>



<Text underline><Title level={4}>Conclusion: The Atheist Moral Argument is a hissing of a scared insecure feral kitten
</Title></Text>

  <Paragraph>
    They hiss:
    <br />
    <Text italic>“We don’t need God to be good!”</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    We reply:
    <br />
    <Text type="danger" strong>“Your entire idea of ‘good’ is a borrowed coat that you’re too scared to admit isn’t yours.”</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text underline>Without God</Text>, there is no:

    <Text mark>Standard</Text>
    <br />
    <Text mark>Accountability</Text>
    <br />
    <Text mark>Afterlife</Text>
    <br />
    <Text mark>Justice</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    Just <Text delete>chemicals pretending to have ethics</Text>.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    The <Text type="warning">secular moral framework</Text> is a <Text italic>sandcastle at high tide</Text>.
    <br />
    It <Text delete>crumbles with every wave of cultural change</Text>.
    <br />
    <Text type="success">Islam is the lighthouse standing above the storm.</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    You can either <Text strong>anchor your soul to divine truth</Text>,
    <br />
    or <Text type="danger">drift in the sea of moral chaos</Text>, <Text italic>drowning in your own contradictions</Text>.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    And let’s be honest: When people say they don’t need God to be moral, what they often mean is—
    <br />
    <Text type="danger" italic>“I want to define right and wrong based on my feelings, not accountability.”</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    But feelings change. Cultures evolve. Trends shift. Without an <Text underline>unchanging source</Text>, morality is just a reflection of <Text delete>societal moods</Text>, not eternal truth.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text strong>God doesn't evolve. His wisdom isn't on a timer. His justice isn't up for a vote.</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text code>Debate over.</Text> Morality belongs to the <Text strong>One who defined it</Text>.
    <br />
    <Text type="danger" strong>K.O.</Text>
  </Paragraph>

    A compass disconnected from north will spin forever. Connect to Allah—or be forever lost in circles.
