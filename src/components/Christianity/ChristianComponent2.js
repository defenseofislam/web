  A man stands in the heart of <Text mark>7th-century Arabia</Text> — <Text italic>unlettered</Text>, <Text italic>untrained</Text>, <Text italic>untouched</Text> by the libraries of Rome, Persia, or Egypt.<br/>
  No maps. No telescopes. No archaeology.<br/>
  And yet — out of his mouth comes a <Text type="success">Book</Text>.

  A Book that <Text type="danger">corrects the historians</Text>, <Text type="danger">confounds the scholars</Text>, and <Text type="danger">predicts the findings of science and archaeology</Text> — over <Text code>*a thousand years*</Text> before anyone else.

<Text underline><Title level={4}>1. The Pharaoh and the King</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Open any Bible.</Text><br/>
  The ruler of Joseph’s time is called <Text italic>*Pharaoh*</Text>.<br/>
  The ruler of Moses’ time? Also <Text italic>*Pharaoh*</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But the <Text mark>Qur’an</Text> — without access to any Egyptian record — gets it <Text type="success">exactly right</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In the story of <Text italic>*Joseph*</Text>, it calls the ruler:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“The King”* — <Text code>Malik</Text><br/>
  (Qur’an 12:43)
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Because modern Egyptology confirms:<br/>
  The title <Text code>“Pharaoh”</Text> was <Text type="danger">not yet used</Text> during Joseph’s time. It only became a royal title during the <Text italic>18th Dynasty (around 1500 BCE)</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Joseph is believed to have lived during the <Text strong>Hyksos period</Text>, when Egypt was ruled by foreign Semitic kings called <Text code>Heqa-Khasut</Text> ("rulers of foreign lands") — <Text delete>not “Pharaohs.”</Text><br/>
  <Text type="success">The Qur’an aligns with this perfectly.</Text>
</Paragraph>

</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And when we get to <Text italic>*Moses*</Text>, the Qur’an uses <Text code>"Pharaoh"</Text> (<Text code>Fir‘awn</Text>) again and again — as it became the official title during his time under <Text strong>Ramses II</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  This level of <Text type="warning">historical precision</Text> — <Text italic>not known at the time</Text>, and even <Text delete>contradicted by the Bible</Text> — is <Text mark>nothing short of extraordinary</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>2. Hāmān: A Name No One Should Have Known
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  The <Text mark>Qur’an</Text> mentions a man named <Text italic>*Hāmān*</Text> as a minister of Pharaoh:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“O Hāmān, build me a tower…”*<br/>
  *(Qur’an 28:38)*
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Critics scoffed. <Text delete>*“Hāmān? That name is from the Bible — but he was in Babylon, not Egypt!”*</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Indeed, the Bible’s Book of Esther places <Text italic>Haman</Text> as a <Text type="warning">Persian courtier</Text> under King Xerxes — over <Text code>1,000 years after Pharaoh</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>But here's the shocker:</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In <Text code>1782</Text>, the <Text italic>Lexicon of Hieroglyphic Inscriptions</Text> had not yet been deciphered.<br/>
  But in the <Text strong>1800s</Text>, after the <Text mark>Rosetta Stone</Text> allowed scholars like <Text strong>Champollion</Text> to read hieroglyphs, an <Text type="success">astonishing discovery</Text> was made.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  An inscription in the <Text strong>Hof Museum</Text> in Vienna, from the time of <Text strong>Ramses II</Text>, mentions a man titled <Text code>“Ha-Amen”</Text>, translated as <Text italic>*“the head of the stone quarry workers.”*</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In ancient Egyptian: <Text code>Ha-Amana</Text> — <Text mark>*exactly pronounced like Hāmān*</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  He worked <Text strong>under Pharaoh</Text>. In <Text strong>construction</Text>. In <Text strong>stone</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="success">Exactly as the Qur’an says:</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“Build me a lofty tower, O Hāmān…”*
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="danger">How could the Prophet Muhammad — peace be upon him — know this?</Text><br/>

3. The Dead King Who Would Not Drown

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  In the <Text mark>Qur’an</Text>, God declares something astonishing:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“Today, We will save your body, so that you may be a sign for those who come after you.”*<br/>
  *(Qur’an 10:92)*
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  At the time this was revealed, <Text strong>no one knew</Text> where the Pharaohs’ bodies were, let alone that any had <Text underline>survived drowning</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But in <Text code>1898</Text>, the mummified body of <Text strong>Ramses II</Text> (or his son <Text italic>Merneptah</Text>) was discovered in the <Text mark>Valley of the Kings</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The body was <Text type="warning">remarkably preserved</Text> — and moved to <Text strong>Cairo’s Royal Mummy Hall</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  It is displayed in a <Text code>glass case</Text>.<br/>
  <Text type="success">A corpse. Preserved through centuries.</Text><br/>

4. The Crucifixion That Shouldn’t Exist


</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  When Pharaoh threatens Moses’ followers, the Qur’an quotes him:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“I will crucify you all.”*<br/>
  *(Qur’an 7:124)*
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Critics laughed for centuries.<br/>
  They said: <Text italic>“Crucifixion didn’t exist in Egypt.”</Text><br/>
  They mocked it as a <Text delete>historical error</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But in the <Text code>20th century</Text>, archaeologists discovered <Text mark>Egyptian papyri and inscriptions</Text> describing the punishment of criminals by <Text strong>hanging or impalement on wood</Text> — even during the time of <Text italic>Ramses II</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  One papyrus from the <Text underline>Anastasi Collection</Text> (<Text code>British Museum</Text>) and another from the <Text underline>Tomb of Horemheb</Text> depict impalement punishments that <Text type="warning">resemble crucifixion</Text>.

<Text underline><Title level={4}>5. The Iron of a King


</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  In the Qur’an, Allah says:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“We softened iron for David…”*<br/>
  *(Qur’an 34:10–11)*
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  This was seen as odd — even <Text type="danger">impossible</Text>.<br/>
  David lived in the Bronze Age, they said. <Text italic>Iron was rare and unusable.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But <Text strong>modern archaeology</Text> now confirms:<br/>
  The <Text mark>Iron Age began exactly around David’s time — 1200 BCE</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The earliest usage of iron tools and weapons in <Text code>Canaan</Text> and <Text code>ancient Israel</Text> appears around this period.<br/>
  The <Text strong>Hittites</Text>, near David’s region, were pioneers in <Text underline>iron smelting</Text> and <Text underline>metallurgy</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And what was iron first used for?<br/>
  <Text type="warning">Weapons. Armor. Chain mail.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Just as the Qur’an describes:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“Make full-length coats of mail, and calculate the links precisely.”*<br/>
  *(Qur’an 34:11)*

<Text underline><Title level={4}>6. Secular “Ethics” Produces Monsters in Lab Coats

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  When morality is unmoored from God, even <Text strong>science</Text> becomes a weapon:<br /><br />

  <ul>
    <li><Text type="danger">Nazi doctors</Text> experimented on children in the name of “genetic advancement.”</li>
    <li>
      <Text type="danger">Planned Parenthood</Text>

      </Tooltip> while smiling for grants.
    </li>
    <li><Text type="warning">AI ethicists</Text> now justify replacing humans to “optimize progress.”</li>
    <li><Text type="warning">Transhumanists</Text> fantasize about rewriting human nature and editing morality itself.</li>
  </ul>

  <br />
  <Text mark>Science without God becomes a scalpel in the hands of a psychopath.</Text><br /><br />

  Because <Text code>science tells you how</Text>, but only <Text strong>religion tells you why</Text>.<br /><br />

  Islam doesn’t reject science—it <Text italic>tames</Text> it.<br />
  It says: <Text type="success">“Advance, but under the banner of mercy, justice, and accountability.”</Text><br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">No God = No Banner</Text><br />
  Just knives and data. Just machines without conscience. Just innovation without soul.<br /><br />

  <Text strong underline>Science is a gift. But without God, it becomes a curse wrapped in code.</Text>
</Paragraph>




<Text underline><Title level={4}>7. Islam: The Last Fortress of True Morality

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Islam is not “subjective.”</Text><br />
  It doesn't shift with trends.<br />
  It doesn’t bow to <Text type="warning">opinion polls</Text>, hashtags, or political correctness.<br />
  What is <Text type="danger">haram</Text> today was haram 1,400 years ago—and will remain haram tomorrow.<br /><br />

  Islam doesn’t whisper: <Text italic>“If it feels good, do it.”</Text><br />
  It proclaims: <Text type="success">“If it pleases Allah, do it.”</Text><br /><br />

  <Text underline>It’s not morality by mood—it’s morality by revelation.</Text><br /><br />

  The <Text strong>Islamic system</Text> isn’t built in ivory towers of theory. It’s lived, tested, and preserved across centuries. It:<br /><br />

  <ul>
    <li><Text type="success">Protects the family</Text>—not redefines it every decade</li>
    <li><Text type="info">Honors truth</Text>—even when it's unpopular</li>
    <li><Text type="warning">Restrains desires</Text>—so the soul is not enslaved by lust</li>
    <li><Text type="danger">Condemns oppression</Text>—whether by kings or commoners</li>
    <li><Text type="success">Demands justice</Text>—not just legal, but eternal</li>
    <li><Text mark>Upholds accountability beyond death</Text>—because no crime truly disappears</li>
  </ul>

  <br />
  This is not just “being good.”<br />
  <Text type="warning">This is moral clarity in a world addicted to confusion.</Text><br /><br />

  While secular morality asks, <Text italic>“What can I get away with?”</Text><br />
  Islam asks, <Text strong>“What will I answer for on the Day of Judgment?”</Text><br /><br />

  <Text underline>That’s not fear—it’s dignity.</Text><br />
  <Text strong>That’s not oppression—it’s discipline.</Text><br />
  <Text mark>That’s not blind faith—it’s Divine Guidance.</Text>
</Paragraph>



<Text underline><Title level={4}>Conclusion: The Atheist Moral Argument is a hissing of a scared insecure feral kitten
</Title></Text>

  <Paragraph>
    They hiss:
    <br />
    <Text italic>“We don’t need God to be good!”</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    We reply:
    <br />
    <Text type="danger" strong>“Your entire idea of ‘good’ is a borrowed coat that you’re too scared to admit isn’t yours.”</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text underline>Without God</Text>, there is no:
    <br />
    <Text mark>Standard</Text>
    <br />
    <Text mark>Accountability</Text>
    <br />
    <Text mark>Afterlife</Text>
    <br />
    <Text mark>Justice</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    Just <Text delete>chemicals pretending to have ethics</Text>.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    The <Text type="warning">secular moral framework</Text> is a <Text italic>sandcastle at high tide</Text>.
    <br />
    It <Text delete>crumbles with every wave of cultural change</Text>.
    <br />
    <Text type="success">Islam is the lighthouse standing above the storm.</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    You can either <Text strong>anchor your soul to divine truth</Text>,
    <br />
    or <Text type="danger">drift in the sea of moral chaos</Text>, <Text italic>drowning in your own contradictions</Text>.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    And let’s be honest: When people say they don’t need God to be moral, what they often mean is—
    <br />
    <Text type="danger" italic>“I want to define right and wrong based on my feelings, not accountability.”</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    But feelings change. Cultures evolve. Trends shift. Without an <Text underline>unchanging source</Text>, morality is just a reflection of <Text delete>societal moods</Text>, not eternal truth.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text strong>God doesn't evolve. His wisdom isn't on a timer. His justice isn't up for a vote.</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text code>Debate over.</Text> Morality belongs to the <Text strong>One who defined it</Text>.
    <br />
    <Text type="danger" strong>K.O.</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
    A compass disconnected from north will spin forever. Connect to Allah—or be forever lost in circles.
