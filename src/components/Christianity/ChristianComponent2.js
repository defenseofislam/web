<Text underline><Title level={4}>1. The Pharaoh and the King</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Open any Bible.</Text><br/>
  The ruler of Joseph’s time is called <Text italic>*Pharaoh*</Text>.<br/>
  The ruler of Moses’ time? Also <Text italic>*Pharaoh*</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But the <Text mark>Qur’an</Text> — without access to any Egyptian record — gets it <Text type="success">exactly right</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In the story of <Text italic>*Joseph*</Text>, it calls the ruler:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“The King”* — <Text code>Malik</Text><br/>
  (Qur’an 12:43)
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Because modern Egyptology confirms:<br/>
  The title <Text code>“Pharaoh”</Text> was <Text type="danger">not yet used</Text> during Joseph’s time. It only became a royal title during the <Text italic>18th Dynasty (around 1500 BCE)</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Joseph is believed to have lived during the <Text strong>Hyksos period</Text>, when Egypt was ruled by foreign Semitic kings called <Text code>Heqa-Khasut</Text> ("rulers of foreign lands") — <Text type="danger">not “Pharaohs.”</Text><br/>
  <Text type="success">The Qur’an aligns with this perfectly.</Text>
</Paragraph>

  And when we get to <Text italic>*Moses*</Text>, the Qur’an uses <Text code>"Pharaoh"</Text> (<Text code>Fir‘awn</Text>) again and again — as it became the official title during his time under <Text strong>Ramses II</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  This level of <Text type="warning">historical precision</Text> — <Text italic>not known at the time</Text>, and even <Text type="danger">contradicted by the Bible</Text> — is <Text mark>nothing short of extraordinary</Text>.

<Text underline><Title level={4}>2. Hāmān: A Name No One Should Have Known
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  The <Text mark>Qur’an</Text> mentions a man named <Text italic>*Hāmān*</Text> as a minister of Pharaoh:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“O Hāmān, build me a tower…”*<br/>
  *(Qur’an 28:38)*
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Critics scoffed. <Text type="danger">*“Hāmān? That name is from the Bible — but he was in Babylon, not Egypt!”*</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Indeed, the Bible’s Book of Esther places <Text italic>Haman</Text> as a <Text type="warning">Persian courtier</Text> under King Xerxes — over <Text code>1,000 years after Pharaoh</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>But here's the shocker:</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In <Text code>1782</Text>, the <Text italic>Lexicon of Hieroglyphic Inscriptions</Text> had not yet been deciphered.<br/>
  But in the <Text strong>1800s</Text>, after the <Text mark>Rosetta Stone</Text> allowed scholars like <Text strong>Champollion</Text> to read hieroglyphs, an <Text type="success">astonishing discovery</Text> was made.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  An inscription in the <Text strong>Hof Museum</Text> in Vienna, from the time of <Text strong>Ramses II</Text>, mentions a man titled <Text code>“Ha-Amen”</Text>, translated as <Text italic>*“the head of the stone quarry workers.”*</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In ancient Egyptian: <Text code>Ha-Amana</Text> — <Text mark>*exactly pronounced like Hāmān*</Text>.

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="success">Exactly as the Qur’an says:</Text>

3. The Dead King Who Would Not Drown

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  In the <Text mark>Qur’an</Text>, God declares something astonishing:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“Today, We will save your body, so that you may be a sign for those who come after you.”*<br/>
  *(Qur’an 10:92)*
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  At the time this was revealed, <Text strong>no one knew</Text> where the Pharaohs’ bodies were, let alone that any had <Text underline>survived drowning</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But in <Text code>1898</Text>, the mummified body of <Text strong>Ramses II</Text> (or his son <Text italic>Merneptah</Text>) was discovered in the <Text mark>Valley of the Kings</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The body was <Text type="warning">remarkably preserved</Text> — and moved to <Text strong>Cairo’s Royal Mummy Hall</Text>.
</Paragraph>

4. The Crucifixion That Shouldn’t Exist


</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  When Pharaoh threatens Moses’ followers, the Qur’an quotes him:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“I will crucify you all.”*<br/>
  *(Qur’an 7:124)*
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Critics laughed for centuries.<br/>
  They said: <Text italic>“Crucifixion didn’t exist in Egypt.”</Text><br/>
  They mocked it as a <Text type="danger">historical error</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But in the <Text code>20th century</Text>, archaeologists discovered <Text mark>Egyptian papyri and inscriptions</Text> describing the punishment of criminals by <Text strong>hanging or impalement on wood</Text> — even during the time of <Text italic>Ramses II</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  One papyrus from the <Text underline>Anastasi Collection</Text> (<Text code>British Museum</Text>) and another from the <Text underline>Tomb of Horemheb</Text> depict impalement punishments that <Text type="warning">resemble crucifixion</Text>.

<Paragraph>
  In the Qur’an, Allah says:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“We softened iron for David…”*<br/>
  *(Qur’an 34:10–11)*
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  This was seen as odd — even <Text type="danger">impossible</Text>.<br/>
  David lived in the Bronze Age, they said. <Text italic>Iron was rare and unusable.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But <Text strong>modern archaeology</Text> now confirms:<br/>
  The <Text mark>Iron Age began exactly around David’s time — 1200 BCE</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The earliest usage of iron tools and weapons in <Text code>Canaan</Text> and <Text code>ancient Israel</Text> appears around this period.<br/>
  The <Text strong>Hittites</Text>, near David’s region, were pioneers in <Text underline>iron smelting</Text> and <Text underline>metallurgy</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And what was iron first used for?<br/>
  <Text type="warning">Weapons. Armor. Chain mail.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Just as the Qur’an describes:

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>6. The Lost City of Iram

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  The Qur’an speaks of a mysterious civilization:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“Iram — of lofty pillars. The like of whom was never created in the land.”*<br/>
  *(Qur’an 89:7–8)*
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  For centuries, there was <Text type="danger">no trace</Text> of such a city.<br/>
  It was dismissed as <Text type="danger">myth</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But in <Text strong>1991</Text>, <Text underline>NASA satellite images</Text> and archaeological teams discovered a buried city in Oman called <Text code>Ubar</Text>, believed to be the city of <Text mark>Iram</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  It was found under the sands of the <Text italic>Rub’ al Khali</Text> (Empty Quarter) — one of the most remote deserts on Earth.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="success">With pillars. With evidence of sudden destruction.</Text><br/>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>7. The Preservation of the Body in the Sea

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Not just Pharaoh — the Qur’an even describes how a sea splits, a people are saved, and the body of their enemy is preserved.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  That might sound <Text type="warning">mythological</Text> — until modern science weighs in.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Tectonic studies, sea-floor analysis, and Red Sea topography reveal:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" code>
  * A submarine land ridge exists in the Gulf of Suez — potentially enabling a natural crossing.<br/>
  * Simulations suggest a strong east wind (as mentioned in the Bible) could create a temporary land bridge.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>Even more intriguing:</Text> Chariot wheels and human remains have reportedly been found in the Gulf of Aqaba — though these claims remain <Text type="danger">unverified</Text> by official sources.

<Text underline><Title level={4}>8. The House of Qarun (Korah) Sinking

<Paragraph>

</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  <Text italic>“We caused the earth to swallow him and his house.”</Text>
  <br />
  <Text code>(Qur’an 28:81)</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  It was once <Text type="danger">considered a fable</Text>. But discoveries in Egypt of <Text underline>collapsed underground palaces</Text>, especially in the region of <Text mark>Faiyum</Text>, have lent credence to ancient accounts of buildings that <Text type="danger">literally sank into the earth</Text> — swallowed by sand and seismic shifts.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Even if not <Text italic>conclusive</Text> yet, the <Text strong>Qur’an’s detail</Text> matches <Text type="success">environmental realities</Text> that <Text italic>no one knew at the time</Text>.

<Text underline><Title level={4}>10. The Ark and Mount Judi: A Forgotten Detail That Couldn’t Be Faked
</Title></Text>

 <Paragraph>
  The <Text strong>Bible</Text> says Noah’s Ark came to rest on <Text code>“Mount Ararat”</Text> (Genesis 8:4).<br/>
  This became the dominant belief for centuries — enshrined in Christian, Jewish, and even popular secular culture.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But the <Text strong>Qur’an</Text> doesn’t say <Text type="danger">“Ararat”</Text>.<br/>
  It doesn’t even mention it once.<br/>
  Instead, the Qur’an says:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  <Text italic>“And it was said, ‘O earth, swallow your water, and O sky, withhold [your rain].’ And the water subsided, and the matter was accomplished, and [the ship] came to rest on al-Jūdiyy.”</Text><br/>
  <Text code>(Surah Hūd 11:44)</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text mark>Mount Judi?</Text><br/>
  For 1400 years, <Text type="danger">critics mocked</Text> this claim.<br/>
  Even Muslims didn’t fully grasp the significance.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But here's the <Text type="warning">striking truth</Text>: <Text strong>Mount Judi is a real place</Text>, and it fits far better with the historical and geographical clues than Ararat.
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>What and Where is Mount Judi?</Title>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>• Mount Judi (Cudi Dagh)</Text> is located in southeastern Turkey, near the Syrian and Iraqi borders — south of Lake Van, not far from ancient Mesopotamia.<br/>
  <Text code>• Arab geographers</Text>, like Al-Mas‘udi (10th century), describe the ark's remains still being shown to travelers on Mount Judi.<br/>
  <Text code>• Josephus</Text>, a 1st-century Jewish historian (in <Text italic>Antiquities of the Jews</Text>), wrote that the ark's remnants were “shown there by the inhabitants to this day” — not in Ararat, but “in the region of the Kurds,” which aligns with Mount Judi.<br/>
  <Text code>• The Syriac Peshitta</Text>, an early Christian Bible translation, also refers to <Text italic>“Qardu”</Text> (related to Judi), not Ararat.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  So, why did the Qur’an name <Text underline>Mount Judi</Text> — a name <Text italic>obscure to most Arabs</Text>, and completely <Text type="danger">unknown to Christian Europe</Text> — over 1000 years before modern historians confirmed it?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And how did it <Text strong>contradict the popular Biblical claim</Text> at the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), which had <Text italic>no way of being challenged</Text>?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Because the <Text type="success">author of the Qur’an</Text> didn’t copy the Bible.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>He corrected it.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  A man in <Text code>7th-century Arabia</Text>, with <Text type="danger">no access</Text> to ancient Syriac, Jewish geographical disputes, or 1st-century historical texts, gave the more accurate name — one that was buried in obscure traditions and local folklore, and only resurfaced through archaeology and textual history.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="warning">No guesswork.</Text> <Text type="success">No copying.</Text> <Text strong>Just precision.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And once again, <Text mark>the Qur’an gets it right.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  <Text italic>“Will they not then reflect upon the Qur’an? If it had been from other than Allah, they would have found in it many contradictions.”</Text><br/>
  <Text code>(Surah An-Nisā 4:82)</Text>
</Paragraph>


<hr />

<Text underline><Title level={4}>So Ask Yourself: Who Could Have Known?

</Title></Text>

  <Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Who could correct the Bible</Text>, outmatch the historians, and align perfectly with the buried truths of ancient civilizations?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Each of these details represents a <Text type="warning">historical impossibility</Text> for a 7th-century human to know:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>•</Text> Knowing the name of an official and even his job from history lost to all — Greeks, Christians, Romans (<Text mark>Haman</Text>)<br/>
  <Text code>•</Text> <Text strong>Correct use of royal titles</Text> — “King” vs “Pharaoh” in proper historical context<br/>
  <Text code>•</Text> <Text strong>Accurate preservation prophecies</Text> — the body of Pharaoh (“We will preserve your body…” Qur’an 10:92)<br/>
  <Text code>•</Text> <Text strong>True punishment methods</Text> — mention of crucifixion, historically accurate to Pharaoh’s Egypt<br/>
  <Text code>•</Text> <Text strong>Era-correct metallurgy</Text> — mention of iron in the time of Prophet David (Dawud), a detail overlooked by Biblical texts<br/>
  <Text code>•</Text> <Text strong>Mention of ancient lost civilizations</Text> — like Iram of the Pillars and the people of ‘Ad
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And all of them stand in <Text type="danger">contrast to the Bible</Text>, suggesting that the <Text type="success">Qur’an is not copying</Text> — it’s correcting human error with <Text strong>divine knowledge</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Who could have known these details — <Text type="warning">not just ahead of their time</Text>, but <Text italic>against</Text> their time?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  A man who could not read or write?<br/>
  Or the <Text type="success">Author of history itself?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  <Text italic>“This is the Book in which there is no doubt — a guidance for the God-conscious.”</Text><br/>
  <Text code>(Qur’an 2:2)</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  <Text italic>“We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that it is the Truth.”</Text><br/>
