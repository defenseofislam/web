<Paragraph>
 <Text mark>The verse John 10:30</Text>, where Jesus declares, <Text italic>"I and the Father are One,"</Text> is often cited by Christians as a cornerstone for the doctrine of the Trinity, suggesting that Jesus and God are one in essence, <Text strong>co-equal in divinity.</Text> But is this interpretation accurate, or is it a misunderstanding rooted in <Text type="warning">exaggeration</Text> and taken out of context? <Text underline>Let’s dive into the scriptures with an open heart</Text>, examine the context, and explore the broader biblical narrative to uncover the <Text code>true meaning of Jesus’ words.</Text> Along the way, we’ll address the <Text type="danger">exaggerating expressions in the Bible</Text>, the unity Jesus speaks of, and what early Christians, untainted by later doctrines, believed about him.

<Text underline><Title level={4}>1. Exaggerations in the Bible: A Call for Contextual Understanding</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>
    Before we delve into John 10:30, let’s first consider the presence of exaggerating expressions in the Bible, which can lead to misinterpretations if taken literally.
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text type="secondary" italic>
    Jesus himself uses such language in several instances.
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text>For example, in </Text>
  <Text code>Matthew 21:21</Text>
  <Text>, he says, </Text>
  <Text mark>
    *"I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer."*
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text>
    Can any Christian today, or at any point since Jesus’ time, move a mountain—or even a single brick—with their words or sight?
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text type="warning">
    This challenge highlights the hyperbolic nature of the statement, meant to inspire faith, not to be taken as a literal promise.
  </Text>
  <br />
  <br />
  <Text>Similarly, in </Text>
  <Text code>Mark 16:17-18</Text>
  <Text>, Jesus states, </Text>
  <Text mark>
    *"And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."*
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text type="danger">
    Again, this is an exaggerating expression. I challenge any Christian to be bitten by a venomous rattlesnake or cobra and survive the poison unscathed.
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text>
    Has any believer ever consistently demonstrated such feats? Does this mean, as the text asks, that no Christian is a true believer?
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text strong>Of course not.</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>
    Jesus’ words here are symbolic, meant to emphasize the power of faith, not to set a literal standard for belief.
  </Text>
  <br />
  <br />
  <Text underline>
    If the Bible contains such exaggerating expressions, how can we take Trinitarian verses like John 10:30 at face value?
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text type="warning">
    These verses, too, may be exaggerations, not literal declarations of divinity.
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text strong>
    Let’s explore John 10:30 in its proper context to see if it truly supports the claim that Jesus is the Creator of the Universe or equal to God.
  </Text>
</Paragraph>

<Text underline>
  <Title level={4}>2. The Context of John 10:30: Unity in Purpose, Not Divinity</Title>
</Text>
<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>
    To understand John 10:30, we must read it in its full context, starting from
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text code>John 10:23</Text>
  <Text italic>. The passage reads:</Text>{" "}
  <Text mark>
    *"And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch. Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me. But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand. I and my Father are one."*
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text code>(*John 10:23-30*)</Text>
  <br />
  <br />
  <Text strong>
    What does Jesus mean when he says, *"I and the Father are One"*? Is he claiming divinity or equality with God, as the Trinity suggests?
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text type="secondary" italic>
    A careful reading shows that Jesus is speaking about his followers—his sheep—and the protection they receive.
  </Text>
  <br />
  <br />
  <Text mark>
    He says, *"Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand,"* and then immediately adds, *"My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand."*
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text type="success">
    The unity Jesus describes is clear: he and the Father are one in purpose—ensuring that no one can take the sheep from either of their hands.
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text type="warning">
    This is not a statement of divinity or a holy Trinity, but a shared mission to protect and guide the believers.
  </Text>
  <br />
  <br />
  <Text strong>
    Moreover, Jesus’ own words in the same passage contradict the idea of equality with God.
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text type="danger">
    He says, *"My Father, who gave them me, is greater than all,"* in *John 10:29*.
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text code>The word "all" includes everyone—even Jesus himself.</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>
    If Jesus were equal to God, this statement would be a contradiction just one sentence before John 10:30.
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text mark>
    Additionally, *Luke 2:52* tells us, *"GOD forgave Jesus’ sins and was ‘charitable’ with him,"*
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text type="danger">
    further showing that Jesus is subordinate to God, not equal to Him.
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text underline>
    How can a being who needs forgiveness be co-equal with the Almighty?
  </Text>
</Paragraph>

  <Title level={4}>3. The Meaning of "One": Unity, Not Essence</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>
    The Greek word used for "one" in John 10:30 is <Text code>hen</Text> (ἕν), which denotes unity, not identity or essence.
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text>
    This becomes even clearer in <Text code>John 17:20-22</Text>, where Jesus prays for his disciples:
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text mark>
    *"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one."*
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text>
    Here, the same Greek word <Text code>hen</Text> is used to describe the unity between Jesus, the Father, and the disciples.
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text>
    Jesus prays that his followers may be "one" in the same way that he and the Father are "one."
  </Text>
  <br />
  <br />
  <Text>
    If <Text code>John 10:30</Text> implies that Jesus and the Father are one in essence, then <Text code>John 17:20-22</Text>{" "}
    would absurdly suggest that the disciples—eleven of the twelve, excluding Judas—are also part of this divine essence,
    making a total of 13 gods!
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text type="warning">
    Clearly, this interpretation is flawed.
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text>
    As <Text underline>www.jewsforjudaism.org</Text> explains,{" "}
    <Text mark>
      *"What John’s Jesus meant by the word hen (‘one’) becomes clear from his prayer concerning the apostles: ‘That they
      may be one [hen], just as we are one [hen]’ (John 17:22), which means that they should be united in agreement with one
      another as he (Jesus) is always united in agreement with God, as stated: ‘I [Jesus] always do the things that are
      pleasing to Him [God]’ (John 8:29)."*
    </Text>
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text strong>
    There is no implication here that Jesus, God, or the apostles are of one essence. The unity is in purpose and agreement,
    not divinity.
  </Text>

  <Title level={4}> 4. Jesus’ Response to the Accusation of Divinity</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text>
    The verses following <Text code>John 10:30</Text> further clarify Jesus’ intent. The Jews misunderstand his words and accuse him of blasphemy, saying,
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text mark>
    *"For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself a God"* (<Text code>John 10:33</Text>).
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text>
    Jesus immediately <Text type="success">corrects</Text> their misconception:
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text mark>
    *"Jesus answered them, ‘Is it not written in your Law, “I said ye are gods”? If He can call them gods, unto whom the word of God came, say ye of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, “Thou blasphemeth,” because I said I am the son of God?’"* (<Text code>John 10:34-36</Text>).
  </Text>
  <br />
  <br />
  <Text>
    Jesus references <Text code>Psalm 82:6</Text>, where humans are called "gods" in a metaphorical sense, meaning they are representatives of God’s authority.
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text>
    He argues that if the scripture can call others "gods," why should he be accused of blasphemy for calling himself the "son of God"?
  </Text>{" "}
  <Text type="warning">
    Notice that Jesus does not affirm the Jews’ accusation of divinity—he denies it, emphasizing his role as one sent by the Father, not as God Himself.
  </Text>

  <Title level={4}> 5.Jesus as a Man, Not a God: The Testimony of Early Christians</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
 <Text mark>The early followers of Jesus, untainted by later doctrines like those of Paul</Text>, understood him as a man, not a God. Peter, one of Jesus’ closest disciples, testifies in <Text code>Acts 2:22</Text>: <Text italic>"O you men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a MAN approved of God among you…"</Text> Even to his disciples and the early Christian community, Jesus was a man chosen and approved by God, not a divine being.

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
This aligns with Luke 2:52, which states, "GOD forgave Jesus’ sins and was ‘charitable’ with him," a clear indication that Jesus was not divine but human, in need of God’s forgiveness and mercy.

<Text underline>
  <Title level={4}> 6. Biblical Unity: A Common Theme, Not a Trinity</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
 <Text strong>The concept of being "one" is a recurring theme in the Bible</Text>, always referring to unity in purpose, not essence. In <Text italic>1 Corinthians 6:15-17</Text>, we read: <Text italic>"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."</Text> Here, believers are "one spirit" with the Lord, yet <Text type="danger">no one claims they are part of a divine essence</Text>.

Similarly, <Text code>Ephesians 4:6</Text> states: <Text italic>"One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all."</Text> This emphasizes God’s singular authority over all, including Jesus. In <Text code>1 Corinthians 12:12-14</Text>, Paul writes: <Text italic>"For as the (human) body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. For the body is not one member but many."</Text> Paul’s message is about unity among believers, not a merging of divine essences.

In <Text mark>Ephesians 4:4-6</Text>, Paul continues: <Text italic>"There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all."</Text> <Text type="secondary">Paul speaks of Christian unity, not a plurality of gods merged into one being.</Text> He was unaware that his teachings would later be misinterpreted to form the foundation of the Trinity doctrine decades after his time.

  <Title level={4}> 7. A Rebuttal to Christian Claims: John 10:30 Proves Nothing About Divinity</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
 <Text strong>Why do Christians, particularly Trinitarians, quote John 10:30</Text>—<Text italic>"I and my Father are one"</Text>—to argue for the divinity of Jesus? This verse, even taken at face value, proves nothing about Jesus being equal to God, and their reliance on it is baffling. Trinitarians do not believe Jesus is the Father, so what are they trying to show by quoting this verse? Are they suggesting it proves Jesus is equal to the Father? If so, they are ignoring the very context of the passage and Jesus’ own words.

Just one verse prior, in <Text code>John 10:29</Text>, Jesus says, <Text italic>"My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand."</Text> <Text type="danger">The Father is greater than all—including Jesus, since Jesus is not the Father.</Text> How, then, can Christians claim that John 10:30 shows equality between Jesus and the Father when Jesus himself states the Father’s superiority just a sentence earlier? This is not an isolated statement. Jesus repeats this in <Text mark>John 14:28</Text>: <Text italic>"Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I."</Text> Once again, Jesus explicitly declares that the Father is greater than him. How can he be equal to the Father when he consistently says the opposite?

Some Christians attempt to explain this away by claiming Jesus was speaking as a man in these verses, that the Father is greater than him in rank and authority, not in essence, due to Jesus’ supposed dual nature—human and divine. But this argument is baseless.

Where in the Bible does Jesus ever say, <Text italic>"I have two natures, one human and one divine, and I set aside my divinity to take on a human role"</Text>? <Text type="danger">Such a statement is non-existent.</Text> Christians are arguing from silence, with no proof or solid basis from Jesus’ own words. In <Text code>John 10:29</Text>, Jesus places himself in the category of "all" when he says the Father is greater than all, leaving no room for the claim that this refers only to rank.

Moreover, the Bible consistently shows the Father’s superiority over Jesus in essence, not just authority. First, the Father is all-knowing, while Jesus is not—Jesus himself admits to not knowing the hour of his return in <Text code>Mark 13:32</Text>. Second, the Father gives Jesus everything, from miracles to doctrine, as seen in <Text code>John 5:19-20</Text>, where Jesus says he can do nothing on his own but only what he sees the Father doing. Third, Jesus begs the Father to save him in <Text code>Matthew 26:39</Text>, showing that life and death are controlled by the Father, not Jesus. Christians may claim, <Text italic>"As a man, Jesus is not all-knowing; as a man, he receives from the Father,"</Text> but <Text strong>I challenge them to provide a single quote from Jesus’ lips affirming this dual-nature doctrine.</Text> <Text type="danger">They cannot. This doctrine is a later invention, not a teaching of Jesus.</Text>

Therefore, <Text underline>John 10:30</Text> proves nothing in support of Jesus’ divinity or equality with the Father. Jesus makes it clear that the Father is greater than him, both in <Text code>John 10:29</Text> and <Text code>John 14:28</Text>, dismantling any Trinitarian claim based on this verse.

  <Title level={4}> Conclusion: A Call to Revisit the True Message of Jesus</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
 The claim that <Text code>John 10:30</Text>—<Text italic>"I and the Father are One"</Text>—proves the <Text mark>Trinity is a misunderstanding</Text> rooted in a lack of context and an overly <Text mark>literal interpretation of exaggerating expressions</Text>. Jesus and the Father are <Text type="success">one in purpose</Text>, <Text type="danger">not essence</Text>, as seen in the protection of the sheep (<Text code>John 10:28-30</Text>) and Jesus’ prayer for his disciples to be one as he and the Father are one (<Text code>John 17:20-22</Text>). The Greek word <Text mark>hen</Text> refers to unity, not divinity, and Jesus himself denies the accusation of claiming to be God (<Text code>John 10:34-36</Text>). Early Christians, like Peter, saw Jesus as a man approved by God (<Text code>Acts 2:22</Text>), not a divine being.

<Text type="secondary">The Bible’s exaggerating expressions, such as moving mountains (<Text code>Matthew 21:21</Text>) or surviving deadly poison (<Text code>Mark 16:17-18</Text>), remind us to approach scripture with discernment, not literalism.</Text> When we read <Text code>John 10:30</Text> in context, alongside other verses like <Text code>John 8:29</Text>, <Text code>1 Corinthians 6:15-17</Text>, <Text code>Ephesians 4:4-6</Text>, and <Text code>1 Corinthians 12:12-14</Text>, we see a consistent message of unity in purpose, not a Trinitarian doctrine. Jesus’ own words, <Text italic>"My Father… is greater than all"</Text> (<Text code>John 10:29</Text>), affirm that he is <Text type="danger">not</Text> equal to God but a <Text type="success">servant</Text> of His will.

<Text strong>Let us return to the scriptures with humility, recognizing Jesus as a man sent by God, united with Him in purpose, and devoted to His mission</Text>—<Text mark>not as part of a <Text type="danger">Trinity</Text> that the Bible does not support.</Text>
