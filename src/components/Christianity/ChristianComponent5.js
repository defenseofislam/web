<Paragraph>
  The narrative of Jesus in Christian theology often portrays him as a divine figure, co-equal with God in the doctrine of the Trinity. However, a closer examination of biblical texts reveals a starkly different picture—one where Jesus is <Text strong>powerless</Text>, <Text type="danger">dependent on God</Text>, and described as a <Text mark>slave (abd) of God</Text>, a term used throughout the Old Testament for the servants of the Almighty.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  This article delves into three critical aspects of Jesus’ depiction in scripture: <Text italic>his emotional vulnerability</Text> and <Text type="success">dependence on God</Text> during the death of Lazarus, his designation as a <Text code>slave of God</Text>, and his own admission of <Text strong>powerlessness</Text>. Through scriptural references, translations, and original languages, we uncover a truth that <Text type="warning">challenges the traditional Trinitarian view</Text>.

<Text underline><Title level={4}>1.😢 Jesus’ Vulnerability: Crying and Begging God for Lazarus</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  The story of Lazarus in <Text code>John 11:38-44</Text> is a profound demonstration of Jesus’ humanity and dependence on God. Multiple translations of <Text code>John 11:38</Text> highlight Jesus’ emotional state as he approaches the tomb of his friend Lazarus:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  “Jesus therefore again groaning (crying) in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.” (KJV, K21)
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The <Text code>Wycliffe Bible (WYC)</Text> renders it as <Text italic>“making noise in himself,”</Text> while the <Text code>ISV</Text> describes him as <Text mark>“groaning (crying) deeply.”</Text> The <Text code>NABRE</Text> and <Text code>NET</Text> translations note that Jesus, <Text italic>“perturbed”</Text> and <Text italic>“intensely moved,”</Text> came to the tomb, which was a cave with a stone placed across it.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The Greek word used here for “groaning” is <Text code>embrimaomai (ἐμβριμάομαι)</Text>, which conveys <Text strong>deep emotional distress</Text>. It can mean “to be moved with anger or indignation” but also deep sorrow or groaning. Jesus’ reaction is not one of <Text type="warning">divine control</Text> but of <Text mark>human grief</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  More strikingly, in <Text code>John 11:42</Text>, Jesus prays to God: <Text italic>“And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.”</Text> This plea reveals Jesus’ <Text strong>dependence on God</Text> to perform the miracle. He does not act independently but <Text underline>begs God to act</Text>, showing the power to resurrect lies with <Text type="success">God alone</Text>, not with Jesus.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>The question then arises:</Text> <Text type="danger">Who truly raised Lazarus—Jesus or God?</Text> The text is clear: Jesus attributes the miracle to <Text mark>God</Text>. This aligns with the biblical narrative where <Text strong>God is the ultimate source of power</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  To claim otherwise is to <Text type="warning">misrepresent scripture</Text> and perpetuate the Trinitarian doctrine, which some argue is <Text italic>“a lie from the pits of Hell.”</Text> This parallels the story of Moses and the serpent in <Text code>Numbers 21:9</Text>. Just as <Text mark>Moses did not create the live snake from a stick—God did</Text>, Jesus did not raise Lazarus on his own; <Text type="success">God performed the miracle through him</Text>.
</Paragraph>

  <Title level={4}>🔗 2. Jesus as the Slave (Abd) of God: A Consistent Old Testament Designation</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
  The second critical insight comes from the consistent use of the term <Text code>*abd*</Text> (slave) to describe Jesus in the Old Testament—a term also applied to prophets and God's servants. In <Text code>Isaiah 52:13</Text>, the Hebrew word <Text code>abd (עֶבֶד)</Text> is used: 
  <Text mark>“Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.”</Text> 🙇‍♂️  
  This verse, applied to Jesus in Christian theology, labels him not just as a servant—but as a <Text strong>slave wholly owned by God</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The same designation is given to prophets like <Text type="warning">Moses</Text> (<Text code>Deuteronomy 34:5</Text>) and even the <Text type="danger">Israelites</Text> themselves (<Text code>Leviticus 25:44</Text>, <Text code>Exodus 21:32</Text>). It's a consistent pattern in scripture: <Text italic>those close to God are described as His slaves</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The Arabic name <Text code>“Abdallah”</Text>, meaning <Text mark>“slave of Allah”</Text>, reflects this reality. In Arabic, <Text code>abd (عبد)</Text> refers to a slave—but in the context of faith, it's an honor, a symbol of <Text strong>total devotion</Text>. As <Text code>Luke 2:52</Text> puts it: <Text italic>“And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.”</Text> 🕊️
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Yet, there's a crucial distinction here: <Text strong>A servant can walk away</Text>, but a <Text type="danger">slave</Text> <Text underline>is completely owned</Text>. This reinforces the point: Jesus is <Text code>God’s abd</Text>, with <Text type="success">no independent will</Text>. 💯
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>Isaiah 11:1-3</Text> echoes this with a prophecy: <Text italic>“The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him—wisdom, understanding, counsel, power...”</Text> 🕊️  
  It ends with a revealing note: Jesus will have <Text type="warning">“fear of the Lord”</Text>. But a divine being <Text strong>does not fear God</Text>—only a <Text type="danger">slave</Text> or subordinate does. 🔥
</Paragraph>

  <Title level={4}>⚠️ 3. Jesus’ Admission of Powerlessness: “I Can Do Nothing on My Own”</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
  In <Text code>John 5:30</Text>, Jesus makes a startling confession: <Text mark>“I can do nothing on my own.”</Text> 🛑  
  The Greek roots drive the point deeper: <Text code>dynamai</Text> (ability), <Text code>poiein</Text> (to do), and <Text code>ou dynamai poiein</Text> (I am not able to do). Jesus admits: <Text strong>I lack power</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  He adds: <Text italic>“on my own initiative”</Text> (<Text code>ap’ emautou</Text>) and clarifies: <Text code>“as I hear, I judge”</Text>. This is not the language of <Text type="danger">a God</Text>—this is the speech of a <Text code>messenger</Text> obeying divine orders.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  His judgment is just <Text italic>“because I do not seek my own will”</Text>, but <Text mark>“the will of Him who sent me”</Text> (<Text code>thelēma tou pempsantos</Text>).  
  If Jesus were God, he would act freely. Instead, he <Text type="warning">awaits divine instruction</Text>. 📡
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  This aligns perfectly with the role of <Text code>Old Testament prophets</Text>—they <Text strong>spoke and acted only when God commanded</Text>. Even miracles were not theirs to wield independently.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>Matthew 7:22-23</Text> warns: <Text mark>“Depart from me, I never knew you…”</Text>—even miracle workers are rejected if they act outside God’s will.  
  <Text code>Daniel 7:25</Text> also warns of a <Text type="warning">“change in time and the law”</Text>, interpreted by some as the <Text type="danger">distortion of Jesus’ true nature</Text>. 🧩

  <Title level={4}>🧠 Conclusion: A Call to Reconsider the Trinitarian Doctrine</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
  The biblical record is clear:
  <ul>
    <li>Jesus <Text mark>wept and prayed</Text> to God to raise Lazarus (<Text code>John 11:38-44</Text>).</li>
    <li>He is consistently described as <Text strong>God’s slave</Text> (<Text code>Isaiah 52:13</Text>).</li>
    <li>He <Text italic>admits he can do nothing on his own</Text> (<Text code>John 5:30</Text>).</li>
  </ul>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  These facts directly contradict the <Text type="danger">Trinitarian claim of Jesus’ divinity</Text>. To equate him with God is to <Text underline>ignore his own words and actions</Text>.  
  As the source boldly states: <Text mark>“Trinity is a lie from the pits of Hell!”</Text> 🔥  
  A shocking claim—but one that reflects the deep scriptural tension between Christian doctrine and biblical language.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  🔍 For further reflection:
  <ul>
    <li><Text code>John 11:38-44</Text> – Jesus’ grief and prayer.</li>
    <li><Text code>Isaiah 52:13</Text>, <Text code>Leviticus 25:44</Text> – Jesus as God's <Text strong>slave</Text>.</li>
    <li><Text code>John 5:30</Text> – Jesus’ <Text type="warning">lack of autonomous power</Text>.</li>
    <li><Text code>Matthew 7:22-23</Text>, <Text code>Daniel 7:25</Text> – Warnings of doctrinal deviation.</li>
  </ul>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  📖 Let us return to the original scriptures with humility, and recognize Jesus not as God, but as the faithful <Text code>abd</Text> of the One True God.
