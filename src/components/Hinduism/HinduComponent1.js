       <Text underline><Title level={4}>Introduction: What is an Avatar?</Title></Text>

<Paragraph> 
In Hindu theology, an <Text mark>Avatar</Text> (from Sanskrit <Text code>“ava” = down, “tar” = to cross</Text>) refers to the descent of a deity — especially <Text strong>Vishnu</Text> — into a <Text underline>physical, earthly form</Text>. These avatars are said to be <Text type="success">divine incarnations</Text>, taking human or animal form to <Text italic>protect the righteous</Text> and <Text underline>restore dharma</Text> (righteousness) when evil prevails. </Paragraph> <Paragraph type="secondary" italic> Famous examples include: </Paragraph> <Paragraph> <Text type="warning">Rama</Text> in the <Text mark>Ramayana</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> <Text type="warning">Krishna</Text> in the <Text mark>Mahabharata</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> <Text type="danger">Narasimha</Text> (<Text italic>half-man, half-lion</Text>) in the <Text code>18 Maha Puranas</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> Even animals like <Text strong>Matsya</Text> (<Text italic>fish</Text>) and <Text strong>Varaha</Text> (<Text italic>boar</Text>) in the <Text code>18 Maha Puranas</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> The core idea is that the <Text underline>Absolute God</Text> takes <Text mark>limited form</Text> to interact with the world. In this world, he <Text type="danger">borns weak like a human baby</Text>, then slowly grows up doing mischief like normal <Text italic>childrens do</Text>, then gains knowledge, and then spends time either enjoying or <Text underline>lollygagging</Text>, and then one day he sees evil going on, then decides to stop it like a <Text type="success">hero in movie</Text> when he discovers something evil is going on. Then he fights <Text strong>heroically</Text> against the villains and the demons just like in the <Text code>marvel superhero movies</Text>. Also he faces difficulty as the villain twists the path to success. After lots of struggle and drama, when he finally defeates all the demons, he returns back heroically, everyone welcoming him and worshipping him because he <Text type="success">lifted off the evil from the society</Text>. And then dies one day tragically like all humans come to an end finally. </Paragraph> <Paragraph type="secondary" italic> All this concept collapses under: </Paragraph> <Paragraph> <Text type="danger">Logical contradiction</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> <Text type="danger">Theological inconsistency</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> <Text type="danger">Moral and philosophical dilemma</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> Let’s explore why the concept of <Text mark>avatar</Text> is fundamentally flawed, and why <Text underline>pure monotheism</Text> (<Text code>Tawheed</Text>) is the only <Text type="success">intellectually and spiritually coherent belief</Text>. </Paragraph>



<hr />

<Text underline><Title level={4}>❌ 1. Logical Contradiction: Infinite Can’t Become Finite</Title></Text>

<Paragraph> <Text strong>Claiming that God becomes human</Text> creates a <Text type="danger">contradiction</Text>: How can the <Text type="success">Infinite become limited</Text>, the <Text strong>All-Knowing become ignorant</Text>, the <Text mark>All-Powerful become weak</Text>, and the <Text underline>Immortal be born and die</Text>? </Paragraph> <Paragraph> It’s like saying: <Text code>“An eternal fire turned into ice but remained fire.”</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> ⚠ <Text type="warning">That’s not profound — that’s incoherent.</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> A being cannot be <Text strong>perfect</Text> and <Text type="danger">imperfect</Text> at the same time. Either <Text underline>God is unchanging</Text>, or He becomes subject to change — and the moment you say He changes, you’ve <Text italic>lowered Him to a creature, not a Creator</Text>. </Paragraph> <Paragraph> The <Text strong>Qur’an affirms</Text>: <Text code>“There is nothing like unto Him.” (Surah Ash-Shura 42:11)</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> <Text type="success">Islamic Tawheed</Text> protects the concept of God from contradiction. <Text type="danger">Avatars introduce absurdity and contradictions.</Text> </Paragraph> <Paragraph> Just think about it — <Text italic>why would God ever need to make himself weak and dependent</Text> to ward off evil? Can't He <Text mark>spare all the drama and time waste</Text> and just <Text strong>remove evil by a blink of an eye</Text>? </Paragraph> <Paragraph type="secondary" italic> True power lies in being above weakness — not embracing it. </Paragraph>

  <Title level={4}>🛑 2. The Avatar System Implies God Is Dependent</Title>
</Text>
<Paragraph>
<Text italic>Why would a perfect, all-powerful God need to “descend” into the world to fix things?</Text><br/>
Why can't He simply command and things happen, like:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text code>“Be! And it is.” (Qur’an 2:117)</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
A God who needs to enter the world, fight wars, or suffer, sounds <Text type="danger">needy, limited, and weak</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Compare this with the <Text type="success">Islamic view</Text>:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>Allah never becomes His creation</Text><br/>
<Text underline>He is above His creation, always in control</Text><br/>
His mercy and justice do not require becoming flesh
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
The moment God becomes part of creation, He becomes <Text type="warning">dependent on time, space, and the body</Text> — things He should have created, not be trapped within.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
In <Text strong>Hinduism</Text> — we see god in human form — <Text italic>dependent on air, water, food, friends, entertainment, gopis</Text>.  
{" "}<Text mark>Allah is not dependent on anything at all.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
So sincerely thinking — <Text underline>who fits in the role of God?</Text>  
{" "}<Text type="success">Allah</Text> or <Text type="danger">Hindu gods?</Text>
</Paragraph>

  <Title level={4}>🐒 3. Animal Avatars Degrade and Disrespect the Divine</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
Some avatars are said to be <Text type="danger">half-lion, half-human, or even boar or fish</Text>.{" "}This raises serious questions:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text italic>Why would the supreme divine being choose to manifest in lower life forms?</Text><br/>
<Text italic>What wisdom is there in taking form as an animal?</Text><br/>
<Text italic>Is God trying to impress or confuse?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
This <Text type="warning">blurs the line between Creator and creation</Text>, leading to religious confusion and even <Text type="danger">idol worship</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>Islam puts a strict barrier between God and creation.</Text>{" "}You can love prophets and saints, but you <Text underline>never mix them with God</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
This line was blurred in avatar belief and led to <Text type="danger">mass polytheism and idolatry</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Some Hindus argue that <Text mark>you can't put a limit to God</Text>.{" "}He can do whatever he wants.{" "}He doesn't act on your intellect or will.{" "}He can do whatever he wants anytime anywhere.{" "}Who are you to question him.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
To answer this as a Muslim, <Text strong>Yes, we can't question God about what He does or not.</Text>{" "}The Quran verse that speaks to this topic is <Text mark>Surah 21:23</Text>, which states,{" "}
<Text code>"He cannot be questioned concerning what He does, but they will be questioned."</Text>{" "}This verse asserts <Text underline>God's sovereignty</Text> and the <Text type="success">ultimate accountability of humans</Text>, not the other way around.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Now, even if we can't question God's actions — still it doesn't mean that <Text type="warning">whatever He does, we will believe blindly</Text>.{" "}We believe <Text strong>God is holy and pure</Text>, <Text success>God is good</Text>.{" "}Now if a scripture (let's say) says that <Text type="danger">God rapes, God cheats, God lies</Text>.{" "}Sounds absurd right?{" "}Now imagine that the followers of those scriptures parrot the exact same argument that you give:{" "}
<Text italic>"He can do whatever He wants.{" "}No one can question Him."</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
So does that mean we should accept that God lies, rapes, cheats?{" "}
<Text strong>No.</Text>{" "}Why?{" "}Because it <Text mark>DOES NOT suit God</Text> to do such things.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Imagine a king begging in a street — the king can do whatever he wants — but <Text type="warning">does this action suit him?</Text>{" "}No.{" "}As a king, <Text underline>this is disrespectful</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Similarly, even if God has the capability to become human — <Text strong>does NOT mean He should become a human</Text>.{" "}Because that <Text type="danger">does NOT suit His nature</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Here the argument that <Text code>"God can do whatever He wants — you cannot question Him"</Text> — this argument will <Text type="danger">not work</Text>.

  <Title level={4}>4. If Concept of Avatar is true - why God stopped taking avatars??</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
Currently, in this world, there are even <Text type="danger">lot more evil than Ravana and Kansha</Text>.{" "}The demons depicted in Hindu beliefs are <Text italic>less evil</Text> than the evil that is currently in this world.{" "}
So if God took avatars to remove evil, <Text strong>why did He stop taking avatars??</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
If <Text mark>Vishnu takes avatars</Text> (like Rama, Krishna) to restore dharma, <Text warning>why did he stop appearing?</Text>{" "}Why no avatars in the last <Text underline>2,000 years?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>1st excuse given by a Hindu:</Text> <Text code>"Kalki Avatar is yet to come!"</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>My reply to that Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text italic>"If Vishnu really cared about humanity, why wait thousands of years while evil spreads?</Text>{" "}
If Kalki is supposed to come only at the end, then Vishnu is <Text type="danger">deliberately allowing suffering to increase</Text> — does that make him <Text warning>merciful</Text> or <Text type="danger">indifferent</Text>?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Lots of children are dying,{" "}lots of women folks getting raped and killed,{" "}
<Text type="danger">justice is still due</Text>,{" "}many people are not getting their hard-earned money due to <Text mark>corruption</Text>.{" "}
Mass genocide happening currently in <Text type="danger">Gaza</Text>.{" "}Why is he silent?{" "}
There were a lot of mass genocides happened previously.{" "}
Why your god didn't come down and fight against them?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Was he weak?{" "}Didn't he know how to dodge bullets and grenades and bombs and nuclear missiles?{" "}
Where was he when <Text code>bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?</Text>{" "}
Where was he when <Text warning>lots of children were dying in Gaza?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Does your god only save Hindus?{" "}
He doesn't care about other culture and faith people???
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Also, why your Gods only took avatars in <Text type="success">India</Text> and not other countries like <Text strong>Russia, Netherlands, Spain, France</Text> back then???{" "}
Were those places <Text italic>paradise</Text> back then or what???
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
If he really cares about humanity and wants to remove evil,{" "}
then <Text underline>he should buy a home permanently here</Text> and stay here until the whole world is destroyed.{" "}
Because if <Text strong>I was in his place</Text> and I decided to take "avatars",{" "}
<Text success>I would have done that</Text>.{" "}
Stayed permanently with my creation and <Text type="warning">fighting against evil</Text> with my <Text mark>divine forces!</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>2nd excuse given by a Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text code>"God only appears when dharma is completely lost. OR Avatars come only when evil fully dominates (like in Ramayana and Mahabharata)."</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>My reply to that Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text italic>"Today, corruption, oppression, and false religions (as per Hinduism) are widespread</Text> —{" "}
<Text warning>why no avatar now?</Text>{" "}
If Vishnu came for <Text mark>smaller issues in the past</Text> (like <Text code>Vamana avatar for Bali</Text>),{" "}
why ignore <Text underline>bigger problems today?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
If <Text type="danger">evil must reach its peak</Text> before God intervenes, then <Text warning>God is allowing evil to grow</Text> —{" "}
which <Text type="danger">contradicts his role as a sustainer of dharma</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Even today, <Text strong>many Hindus are quickly becoming atheists or agnostics</Text>{" "}
when they see <Text mark>criticism of their dharma online</Text> or in <Text underline>YouTube debates</Text>.{" "}
Why isn't God coming down?{" "}Is this because He allows it?{" "}
If yes, then <Text italic>why?</Text>{" "}
Why does He allow this but not the evil of Ramayana or Mahabharata?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
It was not even a <Text warning>global evil</Text> but a <Text italic>local regional conflict</Text> and <Text mark>family issues</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Hindu political leaders keep screaming <Text code>"Dharma khatre me hai - Hindu khatre me hai"</Text>{" "}(<Text italic>Our religion is under danger - Hindus are under danger</Text>).{" "}
Did God become <Text type="danger">deaf</Text> or did He become <Text type="success">too busy playing flute</Text>{" "}
that the <Text strong>cries of Hindus</Text> are not reaching Him?{" "}
<Text underline>What is it?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>3rd excuse given by a Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text code>"We are in Kali Yuga; God doesn’t descend in this age. Avatars only happen in Satya, Treta, and Dwapara Yugas, not Kali Yuga (except Kalki at the end)."</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>My reply to that Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text italic>"If Vishnu is all-powerful</Text>, why can’t he appear in Kali Yuga?{" "}
Does <Text mark>time restrict God?</Text>{" "}
Hinduism claims <Text underline>God is beyond time (Kala Atita)</Text>, yet he is <Text warning>bound by Yugas</Text> —{" "}
This is an <Text type="danger">undeniable contradiction</Text>.{" "}
If Kali Yuga is the worst age, shouldn’t God be <Text type="success">more active</Text>, not less?{" "}
Why should he appear at the end??
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text italic>This is like:</Text>{" "}
If you are a doctor and you realize a person is suffering with cancer in 1st stage, and you don’t treat him,{" "}
but <Text warning>wait until stage 4</Text> — and then treat him.{" "}
If the world knew, would they <Text type="danger">worship you</Text> or <Text underline>curse you</Text>?{" "}
Yes, you cured the patient, <Text strong>but you let him suffer till the end.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>4th excuse given by a Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text code>"God is present in temples and in our hearts; no need for avatars. Vishnu is worshipped in idols (like Tirupati, Jagannath), so he doesn’t need to take human form."</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>My reply to that Hindu:</Text>{" "}
If idols are enough, <Text italic>why did he take physical form in the past?</Text>{" "}
<Text warning>Idols cannot establish dharma</Text>, punish evil, or guide humanity like Rama and Krishna did.{" "}
If God is <Text underline>"in our hearts"</Text>, why do Hindus still wait for Kalki?{" "}
An idol <Text type="danger">can't even remove a fly</Text> if it sits on it,{" "}
and you're talking about <Text strong>restoring dharma?</Text>{" "}
If I grab a Hindu god’s idol and put it <Text type="danger">upside down</Text>, it <Text italic>can’t even fix its own posture</Text>.{" "}
And you claim that <Text type="success">idol will remove evil?</Text>{" "}Nice joke!
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>5th and possibly the final excuse given by a Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text code>"Avatars are symbolic, not real."</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>My reply to that Hindu:</Text>{" "}
If avatars are <Text warning>not real</Text>, then Rama and Krishna never existed.{" "}
This suggests that Hindu scriptures (<Text code>Puranas, Itihasas</Text>) are just <Text italic>stories for timepass</Text>.{" "}
And if they are just stories, then <Text danger>Hindu dharma has no divine foundation</Text>.{" "}
Then why worship imaginary beings instead of the <Text underline><Text type="success">One True God (Allah in Islam)</Text></Text>?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
Hopefully a sincere Hindu now will think about his shaky belief and how weak its foundation is.

  <Title level={4}>5. Tawheed: The Solution to All Confusion</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>

<Text underline>Islam solves every problem</Text> that <Text warning>avatar theology</Text> creates:

<Text success>God is One, absolutely unique and unlike creation</Text> — no incarnations, no part-human forms.{" "}
<Text strong>He sends guidance, not gods in flesh.</Text>{" "}
He <Text mark>does not suffer, bleed, or die</Text>.{" "}
He is <Text underline>eternal, sovereign, and perfect</Text>.{" "}
He’s always in control — <Text strong>never needing to descend or pretend</Text> to be weak.

<Text italic>This belief brings clarity, logic, dignity, and peace.</Text>{" "}
<Text danger>No man becomes God, and no God becomes man.</Text>

<Text code>“There is nothing whatever like unto Him.” — Qur’an 42:11</Text>

Unlike avatar doctrines that confuse between creation and Creator,{" "}
Islam places a <Text strong>firm boundary</Text>:{" "}
You may <Text success>love prophets</Text>, but you <Text danger>never worship them.</Text>{" "}

Islam teaches that <Text underline>the Creator is always above His creation</Text>, not part of it.{" "}
If He wants to stop evil, <Text strong>He simply commands it — "Be", and it is.</Text>{" "}

<Text code>“His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is.” — Qur’an 36:82</Text>

<Text italic>No theatrics, no incarnations, no confusion.</Text> Just <Text success>pure monotheism (Tawheed)</Text>.

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
When truth is pure, it doesn’t need drama — it just shines.

  <Title level={4}>✨ Conclusion: Worship the One Who Never Becomes Anything</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>

The concept of <Text warning>avatar</Text> is <Text type="danger">not divine</Text> — it is <Text italic>mythical</Text>, born of human imagination trying to make God more <Text underline>"relatable"</Text>.{" "}
But in doing so, it <Text danger>drags Him down to human level</Text>, making Him <Text mark>limited, confusing, and dependent</Text>.

<Text success>Islam restores the real image of God</Text> — <Text strong>All-Powerful, Ever-Living, Self-Sufficient, above all His creation</Text>.{" "}

<Text code>If God must become like us to be loved or feared, then that’s not God — That’s weakness dressed in robes of glory.</Text>

🔥 <Text strong>Tawheed</Text> is the <Text code>sword</Text> that cuts through all idol worship and fantasy.{" "}

<Text underline>Worship the One who created avatars, not the avatars themselves.</Text>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
Let the Creator be exalted, not reduced — that is true reverence.
