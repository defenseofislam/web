</Title></Text>

       <Text underline><Title level={4}>Introduction</Title></Text>

<Paragraph> 
  <Title level={4}>Hey reader!</Title> Have you ever heard someone say, <Text italic>“Maybe in your next life, you’ll be a king!”</Text> or <Text italic>“That’s just your karma from a past life”?</Text> <Text underline>Reincarnation</Text>—the idea that after we die, our soul or consciousness pops into a new body—is a big deal in <Text strong>Hinduism</Text> and <Text strong>Buddhism</Text>.<br /><br />

  It’s really a <Text type="success">beautiful, hopeful idea</Text> that promises life goes on, that there’s a reason for everything.<br /><br />

  But let’s be real for a second: <Text type="warning">does it actually make sense?</Text> <Text type="danger">Is this a cosmic scam?</Text> <Text code>Is this brainwashing sugarcoating lie??</Text> <Text code>Is this a method of  manipulation??</Text><br /><br />

  I’m going to walk you through why reincarnation might not hold up, using <Text mark>simple logic</Text> and some <Text italic>heart-tugging examples</Text> that’ll make you think.<br /><br />

  The belief in reincarnation is a <Text strong>core tenet</Text> of <Text code>Hinduism</Text>, <Text code>Buddhism</Text>, <Text code>Jainism</Text>, and <Text code>Sikhism</Text>, all of which originated in the Indian subcontinent. These religions share the concept of <Text underline>karma</Text>, where actions in one life influence future rebirths.<br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">This article will explain the error of believing in reincarnation.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text strong>Killing 4 birds with 1 stone..</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>🛑 2. The Avatar System Implies God Is Dependent</Title>
</Text>
<Paragraph>
<Text italic>Why would a perfect, all-powerful God need to “descend” into the world to fix things?</Text><br/>
Why can't He simply command and things happen, like:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text code>“Be! And it is.” (Qur’an 2:117)</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
A God who needs to enter the world, fight wars, or suffer, sounds <Text type="danger">needy, limited, and weak</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Compare this with the <Text type="success">Islamic view</Text>:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>Allah never becomes His creation</Text><br/>
<Text underline>He is above His creation, always in control</Text><br/>
His mercy and justice do not require becoming flesh
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
The moment God becomes part of creation, He becomes <Text type="warning">dependent on time, space, and the body</Text> — things He should have created, not be trapped within.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
In <Text strong>Hinduism</Text> — we see god in human form — <Text italic>dependent on air, water, food, friends, entertainment, gopis</Text>.  
{" "}<Text mark>Allah is not dependent on anything at all.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
So sincerely thinking — <Text underline>who fits in the role of God?</Text>  
{" "}<Text type="success">Allah</Text> or <Text type="danger">Hindu gods?</Text>

  <Title level={4}>🐒 3. Animal Avatars Degrade and Disrespect the Divine</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
Some avatars are said to be <Text type="danger">half-lion, half-human, or even boar or fish</Text>.{" "}This raises serious questions:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text italic>Why would the supreme divine being choose to manifest in lower life forms?</Text><br/>
<Text italic>What wisdom is there in taking form as an animal?</Text><br/>
<Text italic>Is God trying to impress or confuse?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
This <Text type="warning">blurs the line between Creator and creation</Text>, leading to religious confusion and even <Text type="danger">idol worship</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>Islam puts a strict barrier between God and creation.</Text>{" "}You can love prophets and saints, but you <Text underline>never mix them with God</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
This line was blurred in avatar belief and led to <Text type="danger">mass polytheism and idolatry</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Some Hindus argue that <Text mark>you can't put a limit to God</Text>.{" "}He can do whatever he wants.{" "}He doesn't act on your intellect or will.{" "}He can do whatever he wants anytime anywhere.{" "}Who are you to question him.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
To answer this as a Muslim, <Text strong>Yes, we can't question God about what He does or not.</Text>{" "}The Quran verse that speaks to this topic is <Text mark>Surah 21:23</Text>, which states,{" "}
<Text code>"He cannot be questioned concerning what He does, but they will be questioned."</Text>{" "}This verse asserts <Text underline>God's sovereignty</Text> and the <Text type="success">ultimate accountability of humans</Text>, not the other way around.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Now, even if we can't question God's actions — still it doesn't mean that <Text type="warning">whatever He does, we will believe blindly</Text>.{" "}We believe <Text strong>God is holy and pure</Text>, <Text success>God is good</Text>.{" "}Now if a scripture (let's say) says that <Text type="danger">God rapes, God cheats, God lies</Text>.{" "}Sounds absurd right?{" "}Now imagine that the followers of those scriptures parrot the exact same argument that you give:{" "}
<Text italic>"He can do whatever He wants.{" "}No one can question Him."</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
So does that mean we should accept that God lies, rapes, cheats?{" "}
<Text strong>No.</Text>{" "}Why?{" "}Because it <Text mark>DOES NOT suit God</Text> to do such things.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Imagine a king begging in a street — the king can do whatever he wants — but <Text type="warning">does this action suit him?</Text>{" "}No.{" "}As a king, <Text underline>this is disrespectful</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Similarly, even if God has the capability to become human — <Text strong>does NOT mean He should become a human</Text>.{" "}Because that <Text type="danger">does NOT suit His nature</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Here the argument that <Text code>"God can do whatever He wants — you cannot question Him"</Text> — this argument will <Text type="danger">not work</Text>.

  <Title level={4}>4. If Concept of Avatar is true - why God stopped taking avatars??</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
Currently, in this world, there are even <Text type="danger">lot more evil than Ravana and Kansha</Text>.{" "}The demons depicted in Hindu beliefs are <Text italic>less evil</Text> than the evil that is currently in this world.{" "}
So if God took avatars to remove evil, <Text strong>why did He stop taking avatars??</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
If <Text mark>Vishnu takes avatars</Text> (like Rama, Krishna) to restore dharma, <Text warning>why did he stop appearing?</Text>{" "}Why no avatars in the last <Text underline>2,000 years?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>1st excuse given by a Hindu:</Text> <Text code>"Kalki Avatar is yet to come!"</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>My reply to that Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text italic>"If Vishnu really cared about humanity, why wait thousands of years while evil spreads?</Text>{" "}
If Kalki is supposed to come only at the end, then Vishnu is <Text type="danger">deliberately allowing suffering to increase</Text> — does that make him <Text warning>merciful</Text> or <Text type="danger">indifferent</Text>?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Lots of children are dying,{" "}lots of women folks getting raped and killed,{" "}
<Text type="danger">justice is still due</Text>,{" "}many people are not getting their hard-earned money due to <Text mark>corruption</Text>.{" "}
Mass genocide happening currently in <Text type="danger">Gaza</Text>.{" "}Why is he silent?{" "}
There were a lot of mass genocides happened previously.{" "}
Why your god didn't come down and fight against them?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Was he weak?{" "}Didn't he know how to dodge bullets and grenades and bombs and nuclear missiles?{" "}
Where was he when <Text code>bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?</Text>{" "}
Where was he when <Text warning>lots of children were dying in Gaza?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Does your god only save Hindus?{" "}
He doesn't care about other culture and faith people???
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Also, why your Gods only took avatars in <Text type="success">India</Text> and not other countries like <Text strong>Russia, Netherlands, Spain, France</Text> back then???{" "}
Were those places <Text italic>paradise</Text> back then or what???
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
If he really cares about humanity and wants to remove evil,{" "}
then <Text underline>he should buy a home permanently here</Text> and stay here until the whole world is destroyed.{" "}
Because if <Text strong>I was in his place</Text> and I decided to take "avatars",{" "}
<Text success>I would have done that</Text>.{" "}
Stayed permanently with my creation and <Text type="warning">fighting against evil</Text> with my <Text mark>divine forces!</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>2nd excuse given by a Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text code>"God only appears when dharma is completely lost. OR Avatars come only when evil fully dominates (like in Ramayana and Mahabharata)."</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>My reply to that Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text italic>"Today, corruption, oppression, and false religions (as per Hinduism) are widespread</Text> —{" "}
<Text warning>why no avatar now?</Text>{" "}
If Vishnu came for <Text mark>smaller issues in the past</Text> (like <Text code>Vamana avatar for Bali</Text>),{" "}
why ignore <Text underline>bigger problems today?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
If <Text type="danger">evil must reach its peak</Text> before God intervenes, then <Text warning>God is allowing evil to grow</Text> —{" "}
which <Text type="danger">contradicts his role as a sustainer of dharma</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Even today, <Text strong>many Hindus are quickly becoming atheists or agnostics</Text>{" "}
when they see <Text mark>criticism of their dharma online</Text> or in <Text underline>YouTube debates</Text>.{" "}
Why isn't God coming down?{" "}Is this because He allows it?{" "}
If yes, then <Text italic>why?</Text>{" "}
Why does He allow this but not the evil of Ramayana or Mahabharata?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
It was not even a <Text warning>global evil</Text> but a <Text italic>local regional conflict</Text> and <Text mark>family issues</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
Hindu political leaders keep screaming <Text code>"Dharma khatre me hai - Hindu khatre me hai"</Text>{" "}(<Text italic>Our religion is under danger - Hindus are under danger</Text>).{" "}
Did God become <Text type="danger">deaf</Text> or did He become <Text type="success">too busy playing flute</Text>{" "}
that the <Text strong>cries of Hindus</Text> are not reaching Him?{" "}
<Text underline>What is it?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>3rd excuse given by a Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text code>"We are in Kali Yuga; God doesn’t descend in this age. Avatars only happen in Satya, Treta, and Dwapara Yugas, not Kali Yuga (except Kalki at the end)."</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>My reply to that Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text italic>"If Vishnu is all-powerful</Text>, why can’t he appear in Kali Yuga?{" "}
Does <Text mark>time restrict God?</Text>{" "}
Hinduism claims <Text underline>God is beyond time (Kala Atita)</Text>, yet he is <Text warning>bound by Yugas</Text> —{" "}
This is an <Text type="danger">undeniable contradiction</Text>.{" "}
If Kali Yuga is the worst age, shouldn’t God be <Text type="success">more active</Text>, not less?{" "}
Why should he appear at the end??
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text italic>This is like:</Text>{" "}
If you are a doctor and you realize a person is suffering with cancer in 1st stage, and you don’t treat him,{" "}
but <Text warning>wait until stage 4</Text> — and then treat him.{" "}
If the world knew, would they <Text type="danger">worship you</Text> or <Text underline>curse you</Text>?{" "}
Yes, you cured the patient, <Text strong>but you let him suffer till the end.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>4th excuse given by a Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text code>"God is present in temples and in our hearts; no need for avatars. Vishnu is worshipped in idols (like Tirupati, Jagannath), so he doesn’t need to take human form."</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>My reply to that Hindu:</Text>{" "}
If idols are enough, <Text italic>why did he take physical form in the past?</Text>{" "}
<Text warning>Idols cannot establish dharma</Text>, punish evil, or guide humanity like Rama and Krishna did.{" "}
If God is <Text underline>"in our hearts"</Text>, why do Hindus still wait for Kalki?{" "}
An idol <Text type="danger">can't even remove a fly</Text> if it sits on it,{" "}
and you're talking about <Text strong>restoring dharma?</Text>{" "}
If I grab a Hindu god’s idol and put it <Text type="danger">upside down</Text>, it <Text italic>can’t even fix its own posture</Text>.{" "}
And you claim that <Text type="success">idol will remove evil?</Text>{" "}Nice joke!
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>5th and possibly the final excuse given by a Hindu:</Text>{" "}
<Text code>"Avatars are symbolic, not real."</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Text strong>My reply to that Hindu:</Text>{" "}
If avatars are <Text warning>not real</Text>, then Rama and Krishna never existed.{" "}
This suggests that Hindu scriptures (<Text code>Puranas, Itihasas</Text>) are just <Text italic>stories for timepass</Text>.{" "}
And if they are just stories, then <Text danger>Hindu dharma has no divine foundation</Text>.{" "}
Then why worship imaginary beings instead of the <Text underline><Text type="success">One True God (Allah in Islam)</Text></Text>?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
Hopefully a sincere Hindu now will think about his shaky belief and how weak its foundation is.

  <Title level={4}>5. Tawheed: The Solution to All Confusion</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>

<Text underline>Islam solves every problem</Text> that <Text warning>avatar theology</Text> creates:

<Text success>God is One, absolutely unique and unlike creation</Text> — no incarnations, no part-human forms.{" "}
<Text strong>He sends guidance, not gods in flesh.</Text>{" "}
He <Text mark>does not suffer, bleed, or die</Text>.{" "}
He is <Text underline>eternal, sovereign, and perfect</Text>.{" "}
He’s always in control — <Text strong>never needing to descend or pretend</Text> to be weak.

<Text italic>This belief brings clarity, logic, dignity, and peace.</Text>{" "}
<Text danger>No man becomes God, and no God becomes man.</Text>

<Text code>“There is nothing whatever like unto Him.” — Qur’an 42:11</Text>

Unlike avatar doctrines that confuse between creation and Creator,{" "}
Islam places a <Text strong>firm boundary</Text>:{" "}
You may <Text success>love prophets</Text>, but you <Text danger>never worship them.</Text>{" "}

Islam teaches that <Text underline>the Creator is always above His creation</Text>, not part of it.{" "}
If He wants to stop evil, <Text strong>He simply commands it — "Be", and it is.</Text>{" "}

<Text code>“His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is.” — Qur’an 36:82</Text>

<Text italic>No theatrics, no incarnations, no confusion.</Text> Just <Text success>pure monotheism (Tawheed)</Text>.

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
When truth is pure, it doesn’t need drama — it just shines.

  <Title level={4}>✨ Conclusion: Worship the One Who Never Becomes Anything</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>

The concept of <Text warning>avatar</Text> is <Text type="danger">not divine</Text> — it is <Text italic>mythical</Text>, born of human imagination trying to make God more <Text underline>"relatable"</Text>.{" "}
But in doing so, it <Text danger>drags Him down to human level</Text>, making Him <Text mark>limited, confusing, and dependent</Text>.

<Text success>Islam restores the real image of God</Text> — <Text strong>All-Powerful, Ever-Living, Self-Sufficient, above all His creation</Text>.{" "}

<Text code>If God must become like us to be loved or feared, then that’s not God — That’s weakness dressed in robes of glory.</Text>

🔥 <Text strong>Tawheed</Text> is the <Text code>sword</Text> that cuts through all idol worship and fantasy.{" "}

<Text underline>Worship the One who created avatars, not the avatars themselves.</Text>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
Let the Creator be exalted, not reduced — that is true reverence.
