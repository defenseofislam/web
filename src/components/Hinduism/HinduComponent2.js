<Paragraph> 
  <Title level={4}>Hey reader!</Title> Have you ever heard someone say, <Text italic>“Maybe in your next life, you’ll be a king!”</Text> or <Text italic>“That’s just your karma from a past life”?</Text> <Text underline>Reincarnation</Text>—the idea that after we die, our soul or consciousness pops into a new body—is a big deal in <Text strong>Hinduism</Text> and <Text strong>Buddhism</Text>.<br /><br />

  It’s really a <Text type="success">beautiful, hopeful idea</Text> that promises life goes on, that there’s a reason for everything.<br /><br />

  But let’s be real for a second: <Text type="warning">does it actually make sense?</Text> <Text type="danger">Is this a cosmic scam?</Text> <Text code>Is this brainwashing sugarcoating lie??</Text> <Text code>Is this a method of  manipulation??</Text><br /><br />

  I’m going to walk you through why reincarnation might not hold up, using <Text mark>simple logic</Text> and some <Text italic>heart-tugging examples</Text> that’ll make you think.<br /><br />

  The belief in reincarnation is a <Text strong>core tenet</Text> of <Text code>Hinduism</Text>, <Text code>Buddhism</Text>, <Text code>Jainism</Text>, and <Text code>Sikhism</Text>, all of which originated in the Indian subcontinent. These religions share the concept of <Text underline>karma</Text>, where actions in one life influence future rebirths.<br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">This article will explain the error of believing in reincarnation.</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>Why Do People Believe in Reincarnation?</Title>
</Text>
<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>First, let’s talk about why reincarnation is so popular.</Title> In <Text strong>Hinduism</Text>, they believe your soul, called the <Text code>atman</Text>, is like an <Text italic>eternal traveler</Text>, jumping from one body to another. Your actions, or <Text code>karma</Text>, decide if you’re reborn as a rich person, a poor farmer, or even a stray dog. The goal? Break free from this cycle (<Text code>samsara</Text>) and reach <Text underline>moksha</Text>, a state of ultimate peace.<br /><br />

  <Text strong>Buddhism tweaks this a bit.</Text> It says there’s <Text mark>no permanent soul</Text>, just a stream of consciousness that carries your karma to a new life, aiming for <Text underline>nirvana</Text> to escape suffering.<br /><br />

  <Text type="success">Why did this idea catch on?</Text> Imagine living thousands of years ago in ancient India, where life was tough. Babies died young or were born crippled, crops failed, and nobody knew why. <Text type="warning">Reincarnation gave answers.</Text> It said, <Text italic>“Hey, God can't make mistakes. He is also merciful. He won't probably give crippling disability to this baby. If life’s unfair, it’s because of what you did in a past life. So yeah, maybe this baby did something wrong. Oh? was he born without a leg, hmmm... maybe he cut someone's leg unjustly in previous life so that's why he was born in this life without a leg. Ahhhh..got it, Keep being good, and next time will be better.”</Text><br /><br />

  It’s like a cosmic rulebook that <Text mark>makes sense of pain</Text> and <Text type="success">promises hope</Text>. Plus, it’s comforting. Picture a mom who just lost her little boy. A priest tells her, <Text italic>“Don’t worry, his soul is in a new body, maybe playing happily somewhere.”</Text> That idea <Text type="success">soothes the heart</Text>, right?<br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">But here’s the thing: just because something feels good doesn’t mean it’s true.</Text> Let’s break it down and ask some tough questions.

<Text underline>
  <Title level={4}>Why Reincarnation Doesn’t Add Up</Title>
</Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>1. Who’s Really “You” in the Next Life?</Title>

  Okay, let’s start with a big one: if you’re reborn, what part of you actually comes back? In <Text strong>Hinduism</Text>, it’s the <Text code>atman</Text>, your eternal soul. But here’s the catch—most people <Text mark>don’t remember their past lives</Text>. If you’re reborn as a new kid with <Text underline>no memory</Text> of who you were, no same personality, no connection to your old life, are you really the same person?

  <Text italic>Think about it:</Text> if I lose all my memories and traits, am I still “me”? It’s like saying a new phone is the same as your old one just because it has a similar chip.

  <Text strong>Buddhism makes it trickier.</Text> They say there’s <Text mark>no fixed soul</Text>, just a flow of consciousness, like a river moving from one place to another. But if it’s all new thoughts and no solid “you,” how is that rebirth? Doesn’t it sound more like a <Text type="warning">totally new person</Text> with a vague link to someone else’s past? What do you think—can you call that “you” coming back?

  <Text italic>Let’s make it real.</Text> Imagine a village where everyone says a little girl is the reincarnation of a kind old teacher who died years ago. She knows weird details, like where the teacher hid her favorite scarf. <Text type="danger">Chills, right?</Text> But what if she heard stories about the teacher and her young brain filled in the gaps? Kids are super impressionable—psychologists say they can “remember” things that never happened if adults talk about them enough. So, is it a soul’s memory or just a kid’s imagination? <Text type="success">What’s more likely?</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>2. Where Are All the Souls Coming From?</Title>

  Here’s another head-scratcher: the world’s population is exploding. Back in 1800, there were about 1 billion people. <Text strong>Now? Over 8 billion!</Text> If reincarnation is real, <Text underline>where are all these new souls</Text> or consciousness streams coming from?

  Hinduism says souls can come from animals, so maybe a cow’s soul is now a human. But are there enough souls to go around? If souls are infinite, <Text italic>why weren’t there 8 billion people 200 years ago?</Text> Buddhism doesn’t explain how new consciousness streams pop up either.

  Picture a crowded street in Delhi, kids running, vendors shouting. A Hindu guru might say each person’s life—rich or poor—is because of their past karma. But with billions more people now, were all these souls just chilling somewhere, waiting for a body? Or are new ones being made, which <Text type="danger">messes up the whole “eternal cycle” idea</Text>? Doesn’t that feel like a stretch?<br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>3. Karma: A Nice Story, But Can You Prove It?</Title>

  <Text code>Karma</Text> is the heart of reincarnation. It says your actions in one life decide your next one. Sounds fair, right? But here’s the problem: <Text type="danger">you can’t prove it.</Text> Why is one kid born with a disability and another healthy? Karma says it’s because of past-life actions. But how do we know?

  <Text italic>It’s like saying, “You’re sick because you were bad before, and we know you were bad because you’re sick.”</Text> That’s a circle, not an answer.

  <Text type="warning">Worse, karma can lead to some ugly ideas.</Text> Imagine a young girl, maybe 15, who’s been through something horrific, like rape. According to strict reincarnation logic, her suffering could be because she did something bad in a past life. Or maybe the rapist is “settling a score” from a previous life.

  <Text type="danger">Does that sit right with you?</Text> Blaming a victim or justifying a crime because of an unprovable past life feels <Text underline>cruel, not just</Text>. It’s like telling a grieving dad his daughter’s pain was her fault. That’s not justice—it’s a <Text type="danger">cop-out</Text>.<br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>Bonus POV - Teasing the Reincarnation Logic</Title>

  Hindus always cry when <Text code>Bakri Eid</Text> (Eid Al Adha) comes when Muslims sacrifice goats, cows, sheep, and camels. Hindus say, <Text italic>"You monsters, you all will be reincarnated as animals and you would also be sacrificed by the poor animals who will reborn as humans and then you'll understand how it feels!!!"</Text><br /><br />

  An old Hindu man said the same thing to me. So my little naughty brain countered his claim like this: <Text strong>"Uncle, if you truly believe reincarnation is true, then that could also mean that I am myself taking revenge on the animals by sacrificing them, because they sacrificed me in my previous life? This could also be the case right? If yes, then you don't have anything to say at all! Grab popcorn and enjoy the revenge show!"</Text>

  Then the old man smiled and admitted his defeat saying, <Text mark>"Yeah that's also right."</Text><br /><br />

  So? <Text type="success">Nothing is evil if reincarnation comes in!</Text> Reincarnation does not leave room for forgiveness, it leads only to <Text code>“an eye for an eye”</Text>. And as Mahatma Gandhi said, <Text italic>"an eye for an eye, makes the whole world blind."</Text> So, <Text type="warning">the cycle of revenge will keep going on and on and on...</Text>
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>4. What is even the purpose of Reincarnation?</Title>

  <Text code>Reincarnation</Text> — the belief that souls are reborn into new bodies after death — is central to <Text strong>Hinduism and Buddhism</Text>. According to these traditions, the soul goes through a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth called <Text code>Samsara</Text>.

  The goal of this cycle varies slightly between religions:

  <Text mark>In Hinduism</Text>, it is to eventually achieve <Text italic>moksha</Text> — liberation from the cycle — by worshipping God(s), doing righteous deeds, and purifying one’s karma.

  <Text mark>In Buddhism</Text>, the aim is to attain <Text italic>nirvana</Text>, the cessation of desire and suffering, by following the Eightfold Path and letting go of attachment and ego.

  But here’s a serious question:

  <Title level={4}>🧩 If You Can’t Remember Your Past Life… What’s the Point?</Title>
  
  Let’s assume the theory is true: you made some mistake in a past life, so you're reborn into a new body to try again.

  But if you don’t remember your past life, past sins, or past lessons — <Text underline>how are you supposed to improve?</Text> What exactly are you being punished for? How do you rectify something you have no knowledge of?

 {" "} <Text mark>This is like a teacher giving a student an exam. The student fails.
  But instead of giving feedback, the teacher erases the student’s memory and hands them the same test again.</Text>

  <Text italic>What do you expect will happen?</Text><br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">The student is likely to fail again — and again — and again.</Text>
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>🚫 The Lie of “Merciful Rebirth” — Exposed</Title>

  <Text italic>Hindus love to say:</Text><br />
  <Text underline><Text italic>"At least our gods aren't cruel like Allah — who gives only one life."</Text></Text>

  But let’s break that delusion.

  <Text strong>What’s the point of infinite lives…</Text><br />
  <Text mark>If you remember none of them?</Text><br />
  <Text mark>If you don’t even know what mistake you made in the last life?</Text><br />
  <Text mark>If you're thrown into a new body with zero memory, zero purpose, zero guidance?</Text>

  That’s not mercy — <Text type="danger">that’s torture on loop.</Text><br />
  <Text strong>An eternal, blindfolded punishment</Text> with no map, no feedback, and no justice.

  <Text italic>It’s like a teacher failing you again and again on the same exam —</Text><br />
  but never telling you what you got wrong,<br />
  and wiping your memory each time.

  Tell me: <Text underline>what kind of god would design such a cruel joke?</Text>

  <Text type="warning">Now listen carefully — you genius Hindus —</Text><br />
  <Text strong>Allah doesn’t give only one chance.</Text>

  <Text type="success">He gives you a million — in just this one life:</Text>

  <Text code>Every day, you wake up, that’s a chance.</Text><br />
  <Text code>Every time you hear the Qur'an, that’s a warning.</Text><br />
  <Text code>Every moment your heart still beats — that’s divine mercy calling you.</Text>

  But what do you do with it?<br />

  <Text mark>You waste it</Text> — scrolling reels,<br />
  watching <Text italic>babbling sadhus</Text> with fancy Sanskrit chants,<br />
  who talk for 3 hours and still say nothing.<br />
  <Text type="warning">Thousands of words — zero substance.</Text><br />
  Just noise that protects your ego and confirms your illusions.

  You don’t follow truth.<br />
  You follow <Text underline>comfort</Text>.

  <Text type="danger">And when your body will burn in hellfire and begs for another life…</Text><br />
  <Text type="success">Allah will say — as He said in the Qur’an:</Text><br /><br />

  <Text code>“If they were returned to life, they would do the same things again. They are liars.”</Text><br />
  <Text italic>— Qur’an (6:28)</Text><br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">You had your chance. You ignored it. You lied to yourself.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text mark>This life is your test.</Text><br />
  <Text mark>This Qur’an is your guide.</Text><br />
  <Text mark>This warning is your wake-up call.</Text><br /><br />

  And no, <Text type="warning">you won’t get reborn as a tree or a king or a cow</Text> who might get sacrificed by a mulla in bakrid.

  <Text strong>You’ll return to the One who created your soul —</Text><br />
  And <Text underline>He does not forget</Text>, and He does not forgive rebellion without repentance.<br /><br />

  <Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
    Mercy isn’t in giving you infinite lifetimes of confusion.<br />
    Mercy is giving you truth — and a heart to accept it.<br />
    Use it before it’s sealed forever.

<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>🔁 An Eternal Cycle Without a Guide</Title>
  Reincarnation, as taught in Hinduism and Buddhism, creates a cycle of error without clarity, punishment without memory, and tests without answers.{" "}
  <Text underline>There is no divine feedback, no revelation, no preserved guidance.</Text>

  Just karma, fate, and a mysterious hope that somehow, in some life, you’ll finally get it right — even though you’re blind to what you did wrong in the first place.

  <Text type="danger">This undermines the very concept of moral accountability.</Text>{" "}
  <Text strong>What kind of justice is that?</Text>

  <Title level={4}>📖 Islam Offers a Better Alternative: One Life. One Test. One Judgment.</Title>
  In Islam, there is no reincarnation. You live once, you die once, and you are resurrected for judgment.

  <Text code>“Every soul shall taste death. Then to Us you will be returned.”</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>— Qur’an (29:57)</Text>

  You are held accountable only for what you actually knew and remembered.{" "}
  <Text mark>And Allah sends:</Text>

  <Text type="success">Prophets to guide you</Text><br />
  <Text type="success">Revelation to teach you</Text><br />
  <Text type="success">Signs in your own life to reflect on</Text>

  There’s no hidden karma, no forgotten sins, and no mystery cycles.{" "}

  <Text strong>And what about those who die without knowing Allah or Islam?</Text>{" "}
  <Text type="warning">Don't worry, they are not punished.</Text> Allah does not punish anyone wrongly!{" "}
  <Text italic>Allah will only punish those non-Muslims who, even after knowing Islam, refused to research or took no interest in the truth, or those who knowingly rejected it.</Text>

  But your pagan belief?{" "}
  <Text type="danger">Oh hoo hoo — Even if someone dies without knowing Hinduism or Buddhism — he is still stuck in the merciless cycle of reincarnation.</Text>{" "}
  <Text strong>An endless suffering!</Text>

  <Title level={4}>⚖️ Real Justice Requires Real Memory</Title>
  <Text mark>If you’re punished for something, you deserve to know what it is.</Text><br />
  If you’re tested, you deserve to know the subject.<br />
  If you’re meant to grow, you deserve to be aware of your past.

  <Text type="success">Only Islam fulfills these criteria.</Text>

  <Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
    Reincarnation offers you a cycle with no closure.{" "}
    Islam offers you a clear beginning, a purposeful life, and a final reckoning with full awareness.
  </Paragraph>

  <Text type="success">One soul. One life. One judgment. That’s divine justice.</Text>

  <Title level={4}>🌍 Why Only in Some Cultures?</Title>
  Reincarnation is huge in India, but not so much elsewhere.{" "}
  Christians, Muslims, and Jews usually believe in one life, then heaven or hell.{" "}
  <Text strong>If reincarnation is a universal truth, why isn’t it universal?</Text>{" "}

  Why don’t we hear past-life stories from ancient Egypt or Viking Norway?{" "}
  It seems like reincarnation grew out of India’s way of seeing time as a cycle, not a straight line.

  Imagine a Tibetan kid claiming he’s a monk from 100 years ago, describing old rituals perfectly.{" "}
  <Text type="warning">Spooky, right?</Text> But you don’t hear those stories in, say, Brazil or Russia.{" "}
  <Text italic>Why not?</Text>{" "}If reincarnation is real, shouldn’t it show up everywhere?

  Or is it just a belief that fits certain cultures,{" "}
  <Text type="danger">like how some people love spicy food and others don’t?</Text>

  Also, if you see, very few people claim to remember their past lives while the majority do not!{" "}
  <Text underline>(99% of population do not remember past lives, while 1% do)</Text>{" "}
  <Text strong>If your pagan gods wanted us to believe in reincarnation, then why didn’t they allow it for the majority?</Text>

  Even then, it's totally subjective.{" "}
  <Text type="warning">We have no way to verify if the subject is speaking true or false.</Text><br />
  It could have been considered possible only if the majority remembered their past lives.{" "}
  <Text type="danger">But they don’t — so it’s ruled out!!!</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>🚷 6. How Reincarnation Was Used as a Tool for Discrimination</Title>

  Reincarnation, a core belief in Hinduism and Buddhism, has often been <Text strong>misused to justify discrimination</Text>, tying a person’s current circumstances to their past-life karma.{" "}
  
  In Hinduism, the caste system historically linked social status to karma,{" "}
  <Text mark>suggesting that those born into lower castes, like the Dalits, deserved their hardships due to past-life sins.</Text>

  For example, in rural India, Dalits have been denied access to temples or forced into degrading jobs like manual scavenging,{" "}
  <Text type="danger">with some justifying this by saying their low status reflects karmic retribution.</Text>

  In Buddhism, while less focused on caste, karma has been used to explain suffering,{" "}
  <Text type="warning">sometimes blaming individuals for their misfortunes.</Text>

  Consider a Buddhist woman in Sri Lanka, shunned by her community after surviving an assault,{" "}
  <Text italic>with elders implying her suffering was karmic payback from a past life.</Text>

  <Text underline>Such interpretations foster victim-blaming and social exclusion, ignoring systemic issues like poverty or violence.</Text>

  By tying inequality to an unprovable past,{" "}
  <Text type="danger">reincarnation has been twisted to excuse discrimination,</Text>{" "}
  leaving marginalized groups — like Dalits or victims of trauma — bearing the weight of a cosmic narrative they cannot challenge.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>🤔 So, What Do You Think?</Title>
  
  <Text strong>Reincarnation is a beautiful brainwashing lie, myth, story</Text>, born from our need to understand a messy world.{" "}
  And when you look closely,{" "}
  <Text type="warning">it’s like a house of cards — pretty, but it falls apart under scrutiny.</Text>

  The rebirth of soul thing doesn’t add up,{" "}
  the population boom is a puzzle,{" "}
  not being able to remember past mistakes and the purpose of reincarnation{" "}
  <Text type="danger">demolishes it,</Text>{" "}
  and it’s not even a global belief — even though{" "}
  <Text mark>humanity, specifically anatomically modern Homo sapiens, is estimated to be around 300,000 years old,</Text>{" "}
  with the earliest evidence of these humans appearing in Africa, scientifically.

  <Text type="danger">Plus, blaming victims for past-life sins? That’s not fair.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>Next time someone says, “It’s just karma,” ask them: “How do you know?”</Text><br />
  Or when you hear a past-life story, wonder:{" "}
  <Text italic>“Is this real, or just a good tale?”</Text><br /><br />
  
  <Text type="success">Life’s too short to bank on a next one.</Text>{" "}
  <Text underline>What if this is your only shot?</Text>{" "}
  <Text strong>What would you do differently today?</Text>
