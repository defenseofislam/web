        <Title level={2}>Not All Muslims Are Terrorists, But All Terrorists Are Muslims? </Title>
        <Title level={4}>Abstract</Title>
<Paragraph>
  The assertion that <Text mark>“Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims”</Text> is not only <Text type="danger">factually inaccurate</Text> but also <Text strong>profoundly Islamophobic</Text>. This statement reveals a deep-seated <Text type="warning">prejudice</Text> rather than a legitimate understanding of <Text underline>terrorism, its historical development, and its global context</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  It seeks to <Text type="danger">vilify</Text> an entire faith community—over <Text strong>2 billion Muslims worldwide</Text>—on the basis of the <Text italic>violent actions of an extremist minority</Text>. In doing so, it <Text underline>willfully disregards</Text> the extensive and well-documented history of <Text mark>non-Muslim terrorism</Text>, including state-sponsored, far-right, ethno-nationalist, and other ideological forms of violence.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  To conflate terrorism exclusively with Islam is a gross oversimplification that contributes to xenophobia, hinders global counterterrorism efforts, and fosters social division.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>Let us critically deconstruct this claim using empirical evidence and historical data.</Text> The aim is not only to challenge misinformation but to promote a more <Text success>informed, equitable, and intellectually honest</Text> discourse on global terrorism.
</Paragraph>

<hr />

<Text underline><Title level={4}>1. Terrorism Is Not Born of One Religion — History Proves It</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  The association of terrorism exclusively with Islam is a <Text type="danger">historical fallacy</Text>. Numerous violent movements across religious and ideological lines have employed terrorism to achieve political ends. Below are <Text mark>well-documented examples</Text> that underscore the global and multi-religious nature of terrorism:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>a. The IRA (Irish Republican Army) – Christian Terrorists</Text><br />
  The IRA conducted a decades-long campaign of violence in Northern Ireland. Their actions—including <Text type="danger">bombings, assassinations, and guerrilla warfare</Text>—were deeply rooted in political and nationalist motivations, yet their Catholic identity was unmistakable. <Text mark>Why, then, is the term "Christian terrorist" rarely applied?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>b. The KKK (Ku Klux Klan) – White Christian Supremacists</Text><br />
  Known for <Text type="danger">lynchings, cross burnings, and domestic terror</Text>, the KKK cloaked itself in Christian iconography and rhetoric. <Text code>They invoked the Bible and marched under the cross</Text>—yet they are not broadly categorized as "Christian terrorists".
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>c. The LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) – Hindu Suicide Bombers</Text><br />
  Among the first to institutionalize <Text underline>suicide bombings</Text>, the LTTE—a secular but predominantly Hindu group—assassinated leaders like <Text mark>Rajiv Gandhi</Text> and killed tens of thousands. Despite pioneering the <Text italic>suicide vest</Text>, they are not popularly labeled as "Hindu terrorists".
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>d. Zionist Militancy – Pre-Israel Jewish Terrorism</Text><br />
  Militant Zionist groups such as <Text italic>Irgun</Text> and <Text italic>Lehi</Text> perpetrated bombings and massacres, most notably the <Text underline>King David Hotel bombing</Text>. Figures like <Text mark>Menachem Begin</Text> transitioned from militant leader to Israeli Prime Minister—yet <Text type="warning">“Jewish terrorism”</Text> is seldom invoked in global discourse.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>e. Buddhist Violence – Myanmar and Sri Lanka</Text><br />
  In both Myanmar and Sri Lanka, radical Buddhists have orchestrated <Text type="danger">ethnic cleansing, mosque burnings, and communal massacres</Text>. Monks and mobs, incited by religious and ethnic nationalism, have engaged in sustained violence—<Text mark>yet the phrase "Buddhist terrorist" remains taboo</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  These examples demonstrate that terrorism is not a function of any one religion—it is a method used by those seeking to impose their will through fear. The selective labeling of terrorism based on religion reveals more about societal biases than about the nature of terrorism itself.
</Paragraph>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>2. Statistically, Most Terrorist Attacks Are NOT by Muslims</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Popular narratives often misrepresent the demographics of terrorism, overlooking comprehensive statistical analyses by <Text mark>authoritative institutions</Text>. Data from Europe, the United States, and global indexes consistently refute the notion that Muslims are the predominant perpetrators of terrorism.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>a. EU Terrorism Report (Europol)</Text><br />
  Europol’s annual reports over more than a decade reveal a <Text type="success">striking statistic</Text>: 
  <Text mark>less than 2%</Text> of terrorist attacks in Europe were carried out by individuals identifying as Muslim. 
  The vast majority were committed by <Text type="warning">separatist, anarchist, far-left, and far-right extremists</Text>. 
  This challenges widespread assumptions and underscores the diverse ideological spectrum of terrorism in Europe.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>b. FBI Data (United States)</Text><br />
  According to the FBI, between 1980 and 2005, only <Text mark>6%</Text> of terrorist incidents on U.S. soil were linked to Islamic extremists. 
  The remaining <Text type="success">94%</Text> were attributed to a variety of non-Muslim actors, including 
  <Text type="danger">white supremacists</Text>, <Text italic>anti-government militias</Text>, and 
  <Text italic>animal rights groups</Text>. This data highlights the <Text code>plurality of domestic threats</Text> that are often overlooked in public discourse.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>c. Global Terrorism Index</Text><br />
  Nations such as <Text mark>Nigeria, India, Colombia, and Myanmar</Text> are consistently listed among those most affected by terrorism, yet many of the perpetrators in these regions are part of <Text underline>non-Islamic insurgent groups</Text>. 
  These include political rebels, ethnic militias, and separatist movements. Thus, terrorism is far more often <Text type="danger">contextual and political</Text> than religious.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  These statistics dismantle the myth of terrorism as a “Muslim-only” phenomenon and instead highlight its global, ideological, and multi-religious dimensions. Misattributing terrorism to one faith alone fosters <Text type="danger">harmful stereotypes</Text> and ignores the true complexity of global conflict.
</Paragraph>


<Text underline><Title level={4}>3. Muslims Are the Greatest Victims of Terrorism</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text mark>Ironically and tragically</Text>, Muslims are not the chief perpetrators of terrorism — <Text strong>they are overwhelmingly its primary victims</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Groups such as <Text type="danger">ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, and the Taliban</Text> have committed the majority of their atrocities in <Text underline>Muslim-majority countries</Text>, including <Text mark>Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Somalia</Text>. These violent actors have killed far more Muslims than non-Muslims, devastating entire communities and destabilizing entire regions.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>It is a profound misrepresentation</Text> to associate Islam with these extremist groups. <Text code>They do not represent Islam</Text>, and their ideology is widely condemned across the Muslim world by scholars, leaders, and the broader population.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Associating Islam with these groups constitutes a <Text type="danger">moral insult</Text> to over a billion peace-loving Muslims. It also contradicts the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who explicitly warned against extremists such as the <Text code>Khawarij</Text> — a sect known for their excesses and violence. The Prophet <Text mark>condemned them in the strongest terms</Text>, calling them “the dogs of Hell” for their extremism and misinterpretation of religious teachings.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  To equate Islam with the ideology of terrorist groups is not only intellectually dishonest but perpetuates injustice against those who suffer the most from terrorism: Muslims themselves.
</Paragraph>



<Text underline><Title level={4}>4. The Media Fuels This Islamophobic Lie</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  One of the <Text strong>key drivers</Text> behind the persistent association of Islam with terrorism is the <Text mark>systemic bias in Western media representation</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The media often engages in <Text type="danger">selective labeling</Text> based on the perpetrator's religion or ethnicity. For instance:
  <br />
  • When a <Text code>white man</Text> commits a mass shooting, the headlines describe him as <Text type="warning">“mentally ill”</Text> or a “lone wolf”.
  <br />
  • When a <Text code>Hindu mob</Text> lynches Muslims in India, the event is framed as <Text type="success">“communal violence”</Text>, avoiding the word “terrorism”.
  <br />
  • When a <Text code>Buddhist monk</Text> incites or commits violence against Muslims in Myanmar, it's labeled as <Text italic>“sectarian unrest”</Text>.
  <br />
  • But when a <Text code>Muslim</Text> is involved in violence, regardless of context or motive, the incident is swiftly termed <Text type="danger">“Islamic terrorism”</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  This <Text underline>double standard</Text> in terminology and coverage is not only <Text strong>intellectually dishonest</Text>, it contributes to a broader climate of suspicion, <Text type="danger">fuels Islamophobia</Text>, and exacerbates social divisions. Such media framing reinforces stereotypes and <Text mark>dehumanizes Muslim communities</Text>, placing innocent individuals at heightened risk of discrimination, hate crimes, and marginalization.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>Academic studies in media analysis</Text> have repeatedly shown that Muslim perpetrators are vastly overrepresented in terrorism-related reporting, while similar or more frequent attacks by non-Muslims receive <Text type="warning">far less attention</Text> or are contextualized in humanizing or neutral terms.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The consequences are profound: <Text type="danger">policies are shaped</Text> by public perception, and public perception is shaped by media narratives. When these narratives are distorted, they lead to <Text strong>injustice on a societal and systemic level</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  A truly fair and informed discourse on terrorism must begin by challenging these biases and applying consistent standards of reporting and judgment, regardless of faith or background.
</Paragraph>


<Text underline><Title level={4}>5. Islam Does Not Preach Terrorism</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Let us be unequivocally clear:</Text> Islam, in both its sacred texts and lived tradition, <Text underline>categorically condemns violence against innocents</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  <Text code>“Whoever kills a person [unjustly]... it is as if he had slain all mankind.”</Text>
  <br />
  — <Text mark>Qur’an 5:32</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  <Text code>“The most beloved of people to Allah are those who bring the most benefit to others.”</Text>
  <br />
  — <Text mark>Prophet Muhammad (Sunan al-Kubra)</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  These foundational teachings articulate an <Text type="success">ethos of compassion, sanctity of life, and social responsibility</Text> at the core of Islamic belief. The Quran and the Prophetic tradition consistently uphold the value of human life and prohibit the killing of:
  <br />
  • <Text strong>Innocents</Text><br />
  • <Text strong>Women and children</Text><br />
  • <Text strong>Non-combatants and religious clergy</Text> — even in times of war
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The principles of <Text mark>just war (qitāl)</Text> in Islam are governed by stringent ethical guidelines, emphasizing that aggression, transgression, and cruelty are <Text type="danger">explicitly forbidden</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>True Islam</Text> is not a creed of violence but one of <Text type="success">peace, justice, and mercy</Text>. Any distortion of these principles by extremist ideologies is a betrayal of Islamic doctrine, not an expression of it.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  It is both a scholarly and moral imperative to distinguish the actions of extremists from the teachings of the faith they falsely claim to represent.
</Paragraph>


<Text underline><Title level={4}>Conclusion: Shatter the Stereotype</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>The claim that “all terrorists are Muslims” is not just a myth — it is a </Text>
  <Text type="danger" strong>malicious falsehood</Text>, <Text italic>crafted by bigots</Text> and 
  {" "}<Text type="warning">amplified by ignorance and fear</Text>. It is a dangerously effective 
  <Text code>weapon of misinformation</Text> — one used to <Text underline>dehumanize an entire faith community</Text>, 
  justify <Text type="danger">state violence</Text>, and <Text type="danger">silence the voices of peace-loving Muslims</Text> around the world.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Muslims are not defined by headlines — they are defined by their humanity.
  They are <Text type="success">doctors saving lives</Text>, <Text type="success">engineers building futures</Text>,
  {" "}<Text type="success">teachers shaping minds</Text>, <Text type="success">artists inspiring souls</Text>, and
  {" "}<Text type="success">neighbors who offer warmth, kindness, and dignity</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  To reduce over <Text strong>2 billion Muslims</Text> to the actions of a fringe minority is not only 
  {" "}<Text type="danger">morally reprehensible</Text>, it is <Text type="danger">intellectually bankrupt</Text> and 
  {" "}<Text italic>deeply unjust</Text>. It is an affront to truth, and an insult to every Muslim 
  who strives for good in their family, community, and society.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>We must rise higher</Text>: confront ignorance with knowledge, 
  dismantle prejudice with truth, and overcome hatred with <Text mark>courageous compassion</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  Because justice does not begin with power — it begins with understanding.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>If you say:</Text> <Text mark>“Not all Muslims are terrorists, but why are all terrorists Muslims?”</Text>
  <br />
  <Text italic>Then don’t cry when we say:</Text> <Text mark>“Not all men are rapists, but why are all rapists men?”</Text>
  <br />
  <Text type="danger" strong>See how dumb that sounds now?</Text> 
  {" "}<Text>Congratulations, you’ve just been roasted by basic logic, philosophy and karma.</Text>
  <br />
  <Text type="success">Next time, try using your brain before your keyboard.</Text> 🧠💥
