<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>
    The origin of the <Text strong>Kashmir conflict</Text> is rooted in the{" "}
    <Text type="danger">turbulent partition</Text> of British India in 1947,
    which led to the emergence of <Text strong>India</Text> and{" "}
    <Text strong>Pakistan</Text> as sovereign states.
  </Text>{" "}
  The princely state of <Text mark>Jammu and Kashmir</Text>, ruled by a{" "}
  <Text strong>Hindu Maharaja</Text> over a{" "}
  <Text type="warning">Muslim-majority population</Text>, initially opted for{" "}
  <Text underline>independence</Text>. However, following a{" "}
  <Text type="danger">tribal invasion</Text> from Pakistan in October 1947,
  the Maharaja signed the <Text code>Instrument of Accession</Text> to India
  in exchange for military aid.

<Title level={4}>Background & Historical Context</Title>
<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>
    Before the <Text strong>partition of British India</Text> in 1947,{" "}
    <Text mark>Jammu and Kashmir</Text> was one of the largest and most
    strategically significant princely states in the Indian subcontinent.
  </Text>{" "}
  Governed by the <Text strong>Dogra dynasty</Text> under Maharaja Hari Singh,
  the region was a mosaic of <Text type="warning">ethnic</Text>,{" "}
  <Text type="warning">linguistic</Text>, and{" "}
  <Text type="warning">religious diversity</Text>, with a{" "}
  <Text strong>Muslim-majority population</Text> ruled by a{" "}
  <Text strong>Hindu monarch</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The state was established as part of the <Text code>Amritsar Treaty (1846)</Text> 
  when the British transferred the territory to <Text strong>Gulab Singh</Text> 
  for 7.5 million rupees following the First Anglo-Sikh War. This laid the foundation 
  of Dogra rule, which lasted for over a century.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Despite being formally autonomous, Kashmir remained under the{" "}
  <Text type="secondary" italic>indirect control</Text> of the British Crown, 
  with foreign affairs and defense handled by the British. The Dogra rulers maintained 
  strong ties with the British Raj and implemented a centralized, often{" "} 
  <Text type="danger">repressive rule</Text> over the region’s Muslim peasantry.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text underline>
    By the early 20th century, <Text strong>socio-political unrest</Text> had begun to surface, 
    driven by <Text type="warning">economic inequality</Text>,{" "}
    <Text type="warning">religious discrimination</Text>, and rising{" "}
    <Text type="danger">calls for self-governance</Text>.
  </Text>{" "}
  These tensions would later become instrumental in the post-1947 {" "}
  <Text strong>territorial dispute</Text> between India and Pakistan.
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>The Problem of Partition and Its Effect on Kashmir</Title>

<Paragraph>
  When the British decided to leave India in <Text code>1947</Text>, they chose to divide the land into two new countries:{" "}
  <Text type="danger">India</Text> and <Text type="success">Pakistan</Text>. This division was mainly based on{" "}
  <Text strong>religion</Text>—Hindus in India and Muslims in Pakistan. This decision caused{" "}
  <Text type="warning">huge violence</Text>, confusion, and{" "}
  <Text type="danger">millions of people to leave their homes</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  At that time, there were more than <Text code>560 princely states</Text> ruled by local kings. These states were given the{" "}
  <Text strong>choice to join either India or Pakistan</Text> based on{" "}
  <Text strong>location</Text> and the <Text strong>religion of most people living there</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Jammu and Kashmir</Text> was one of these princely states. It had a{" "}
  <Text strong>Muslim majority population</Text> but was ruled by a{" "}
  <Text type="danger">Hindu king</Text>, Maharaja Hari Singh. He did not want to join either country right away and{" "}
  <Text type="warning">wanted to stay independent</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In <Text code>October 1947</Text>, a critical decision was made by <Text strong>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</Text>, the founder of Pakistan. As the princely state of <Text mark>Jammu and Kashmir</Text> had not yet joined either India or Pakistan, Jinnah feared the ruler might choose to join India. To stop this, he approved a plan to send <Text type="danger">armed tribal fighters</Text> from the North-West Frontier Province—mainly <Text mark>Pashtun tribesmen</Text>—to invade Kashmir. These tribes were poorly disciplined and caused heavy violence, looting, and killings in the region, especially in places like <Text italic>Baramulla</Text>. Their goal was to take control of Kashmir before the king made an official decision. This move by Jinnah was not just a military action—it was also a way to <Text strong>change the political situation by force</Text>. However, the plan backfired. The brutal actions of the invaders frightened the king, <Text strong>Maharaja Hari Singh</Text>, and pushed him to urgently seek military help from India. In return, the Maharaja signed a <Text code>legal agreement</Text> called the <Text code>Instrument of Accession</Text>, <Text strong> <Text mark>officially joining India.</Text></Text>. Only after this legal step did India send its army to protect Kashmir. Thus, Jinnah’s attempt to take Kashmir by force not only failed but also gave India <Text underline>legal and moral grounds</Text> to enter and protect the region.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>
    This event was the beginning of the <Text underline>Kashmir conflict</Text>.
  </Text>{" "}
  A <Text type="danger">religious division made by the British</Text> led to a{" "}
  <Text type="warning">serious and long-lasting conflict</Text> between India and Pakistan.{" "}
  <Text mark>Kashmir became a disputed land</Text>, with both countries claiming it as their own.
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>Why Kashmir Belongs to India: Legally, Ethically, and Historically</Title>

<Paragraph>
  After the 1947 invasion by tribal fighters from Pakistan, the ruler of Jammu and Kashmir,{" "}
  <Text strong>Maharaja Hari Singh</Text>, officially chose to join India by signing the{" "}
  <Text code>Instrument of Accession</Text>. This was a{" "}
  <Text strong>legal and final agreement</Text> accepted by the{" "}
  <Text mark>Government of India</Text> and also supported by the last British Viceroy,{" "}
  <Text underline>Lord Mountbatten</Text>. This makes Kashmir's entry into India{" "}
  <Text type="success">fully legal under international law</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Ethically, the decision was made to protect the people of Kashmir. The{" "}
  <Text type="danger">Pakistani tribal invasion</Text> caused fear, death, and damage.{" "}
  <Text strong>India sent its army only after the Maharaja asked for help</Text> and joined India officially. This shows{" "}
  <Text mark>India acted with permission</Text>, not by force.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Historically</Text>, Kashmir has been part of Indian civilization for{" "}
  <Text type="warning">thousands of years</Text>. It was home to{" "}
  <Text mark>Hindu, Buddhist, and later Muslim cultures</Text>. Important Indian texts like the{" "}
  <Text italic>Rajatarangini</Text> speak about Kashmir as an Indian region.{" "}
  <Text strong>Even under Mughal and Sikh rule</Text>, Kashmir remained part of Indian kingdoms, not foreign ones.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Kashmir’s connection to India</Text> is based on{" "}
  <Text underline>law</Text>, <Text underline>mutual agreement</Text>, and{" "}
  <Text underline>shared history</Text>. Attempts to question this are{" "}
  <Text type="danger">politically motivated</Text> and ignore the{" "}
  <Text type="success">facts of history</Text>.
</Paragraph>


<Title level={4}>Pakistan's Counterarguments on Kashmir</Title>

<Paragraph>
  The government of <Text strong>Pakistan</Text> has long argued that <Text mark>Kashmir should belong to Pakistan</Text> based on religious grounds. Since Kashmir had a <Text type="warning">Muslim majority population</Text> at the time of partition in 1947, Pakistani leaders claimed that it was natural for the region to join Pakistan. They also say that <Text strong>Maharaja Hari Singh</Text>, the Hindu ruler of a mostly Muslim state, had no right to decide the future of millions of Muslim citizens without their consent. Another argument is that the <Text code>Instrument of Accession</Text> was signed under pressure and during an invasion, making it invalid in their view. Pakistan also points to <Text mark>United Nations resolutions</Text> passed in 1948 and later, which suggested that a <Text underline>plebiscite</Text> (public vote) should be held to let the people of Kashmir decide whether to join India or Pakistan. They argue that <Text type="danger">India has never allowed this vote</Text>, which they believe goes against democratic and international principles. For these reasons, Pakistan continues to claim that the <Text type="warning">final status of Kashmir</Text> is still open and should be decided by the people of the region.
</Paragraph>


<Title level={4}>Refuting Pakistan’s Claims: Legal and Historical Facts</Title>

<Paragraph>
  Pakistan’s main argument is based on the idea that <Text mark>Kashmir should have joined Pakistan</Text> because it had a Muslim majority. However, this view ignores important legal and historical facts. First, <Text strong>Kashmir was not a British province</Text>—it was one of the 562 <Text code>princely states</Text> under British suzerainty. These princely states were <Text type="success">not directly ruled by the British</Text>, and they were given the legal right to <Text strong>choose whether to join India, Pakistan, or remain independent</Text> after partition.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The decision was not based on religion alone. The <Text code>Indian Independence Act of 1947</Text> clearly gave rulers of princely states the power to decide their future. The <Text strong>“Two Nation Theory”</Text> applied only to <Text underline>British-ruled provinces</Text> that were to be divided based on religious majority—not to princely states. So the Maharaja of Kashmir, <Text strong>Hari Singh</Text>, had the full legal right to sign the <Text code>Instrument of Accession</Text> and join India, which he did on <Text code>October 26, 1947</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Therefore, Pakistan’s claim that Kashmir “should” have joined it due to religion <Text delete>does not hold up</Text> under the laws and agreements of that time. <Text type="warning">Kashmir’s accession to India was not forced</Text>—it was a <Text strong>legal decision by its ruler</Text>, just as other princely states like Junagadh and Hyderabad made their own decisions. Ignoring this legal framework and focusing only on religion is not historically or legally accurate.
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>Conclusion: Why Kashmir Rightfully Belongs to India</Title>

<Paragraph>
  In conclusion, the <Text strong>legal</Text>, <Text strong>historical</Text>, and <Text strong>ethical</Text> reasons demonstrate that Kashmir rightfully belongs to India. The princely state of Kashmir, under the rule of Maharaja Hari Singh, was given the right to choose its future after British withdrawal, just like every other princely state. Despite Pakistan’s claims based on religion, Kashmir’s decision to accede to India was fully in line with the <Text code>law of the time</Text>. The Maharaja’s choice to sign the <Text code>Instrument of Accession</Text> on <Text mark>October 26, 1947</Text>, was a <Text type="success">legitimate</Text> and voluntary act, confirmed by both <Text code>legal frameworks</Text> and international agreements.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Furthermore, the Kashmir dispute is not grounded in the partition of India based on religious majorities, as Pakistan suggests. The <Text strong>Two Nation Theory</Text>, which argued for the division of British India along religious lines, was meant for British provinces, not princely states. Kashmir’s accession was a <Text strong>sovereign decision</Text> made by its ruler. As such, the region’s future was decided based on the principles of <Text underline>legality</Text> and <Text underline>self-determination</Text>, not religious identity.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Over the years, India has shown a commitment to Kashmir’s <Text type="success">integration</Text>, offering autonomy and development to the region. Any claim to Kashmir by Pakistan is not supported by <Text type="danger">legal</Text>, <Text type="danger">historical</Text>, or <Text type="danger">ethical</Text> grounds. Therefore, Kashmir, both legally and historically, <Text strong>fully belongs to India</Text> and will continue to be an <Text strong>integral part</Text> of the nation.
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>Optimal Solution for the Kashmir Conflict</Title>

<Paragraph>
  The Kashmir conflict, with its complex historical, political, and emotional dimensions, requires a <Text strong>holistic approach</Text> that prioritizes the <Text strong>well-being</Text> of the people in the region and respects the <Text underline>sovereignty</Text> of both India and Pakistan. The optimal solution lies in fostering dialogue, trust-building, and a commitment to peace through the following steps:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  - <Text mark>Engagement in Comprehensive Dialogue:</Text> The first step towards a lasting solution is the resumption of dialogue between the governments of India and Pakistan, with a strong emphasis on addressing the aspirations and concerns of the people of Kashmir. The involvement of <Text type="warning">regional stakeholders</Text> and <Text type="warning">international mediators</Text> could help ensure that the process remains impartial and focused on long-term peace.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  - <Text mark>Respect for Human Rights:</Text> Any resolution must prioritize the protection of human rights in Kashmir. Both India and Pakistan must work together to <Text underline>ensure the security</Text> and <Text underline>dignity</Text> of the people living in the region, fostering an environment of safety and stability for all communities.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  - <Text mark>Promotion of Economic Development:</Text> Kashmir’s economic potential must be unlocked by encouraging <Text strong>cross-border cooperation</Text> on trade, infrastructure, and regional development. Both India and Pakistan can benefit from collaborative projects that bring economic prosperity, improve living standards, and enhance people-to-people connections across borders.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  - <Text mark>Gradual Autonomy for Kashmir:</Text> A practical approach would be to grant Kashmir a higher degree of <Text type="success">autonomy</Text> within the Indian Union, allowing the region to make more decisions regarding its cultural, economic, and social matters while remaining a part of India. This would address some of the grievances while preserving India’s <Text strong>territorial integrity</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  - <Text mark>Focus on Confidence-Building Measures:</Text> Trust-building between India and Pakistan, as well as between the people of Kashmir and the central governments, is essential. This can be achieved through regular <Text type="warning">confidence-building measures</Text> such as exchanges in education, sports, and cultural activities. The goal should be to move beyond historical grievances and build mutual respect and understanding.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In conclusion, the optimal solution to the Kashmir conflict lies in a balanced and multi-faceted approach that emphasizes <Text underline>dialogue, human rights, economic collaboration, and regional autonomy</Text>, while respecting the sovereign rights of both nations. Only through sustained peace efforts, mutual trust, and long-term cooperation can a just and peaceful resolution to the Kashmir issue be achieved, benefiting the people of Kashmir, India, and Pakistan.
