Introduction
</Title>

<Paragraph>

  <Text strong>Ladies and gentlemen</Text>, let us confront the <Text mark>undeniable truth</Text>:
  the official narrative of <Text strong>September 11, 2001</Text> is a 
  <Text type="danger">{" "}carefully constructed lie</Text>.<br /><br />

  The evidence, <Text italic>meticulously documented yet not accepted</Text>, reveals a 
  <Text strong>{" "}web of deception</Text> so vast that it implicates the 
  <Text type="danger">{" "}highest levels of power</Text> in the United States government.<br /><br />

  This was <Text strong>not</Text> the work of 19 hijackers with box cutters; 
  it was an <Text underline>inside job</Text>, a 
  <Text strong><Text italic>{" "}false flag operation</Text></Text> designed to manipulate public perception, justify wars, 
  and consolidate control.<br /><br />

  <Text strong>Alright, let’s dive into this.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text code>
    I’m laying out the case, that 9/11 was a lie — a meticulously orchestrated deception that doesn’t hold up under scrutiny.
  </Text><br /><br />

  <Text type="warning">The evidence is overwhelming</Text>, 
  <Text type="danger">the inconsistencies are glaring</Text>, and the official narrative 
  <Text delete> {" "}crumbles</Text> when you look at the facts.

<Text underline><Title level={4}>1. Operation Northwoods</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>

  <Text italic>
    Let’s start with Operation Northwoods, a chilling precedent from March 13, 1962.
  </Text> The Joint Chiefs of Staff, led by <Text strong>Lyman Lemnitzer</Text>, proposed staging 
  <Text type="danger">{" "}terrorist attacks</Text> around Guantanamo Bay to justify invading Cuba.<br /><br />

  This wasn’t some <Text delete>conspiracy theory</Text>—it’s a 
  <Text mark>{" "}declassified document</Text>.<br /><br />

  They planned <Text type="warning">fake attacks</Text>, 
  staged funerals for <Text italic>mock victims</Text>, and even blowing up a  {" "}
  <Text underline>drone aircraft</Text> disguised as a civilian plane, with federal agents posing as college students. 
  <Text code>Sound familiar?</Text><br /><br />

  The plan was to <Text strong>swap a real plane for a drone</Text>, land the real one at 
  Eglin Air Force Base, and blow up the drone over Cuban waters to fake a crisis.<br /><br />

  <Text type="success">President Kennedy rejected it and fired Lemnitzer</Text>, 
  but this shows the U.S. government was willing to consider 
  <Text strong>{" "}false flag operations</Text> to manipulate public opinion.<br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">
    They were ready to stage a terror attack then — if they thought about it in ’62, why not in 2001?

<Text underline><Title level={4}>2.Proof of Remote-Control Capabilities
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Fast forward to <Text mark>December 1, 1984</Text>. NASA crash-landed a  {" "}
  <Text strong>remote-controlled Boeing 720</Text> at 
  <Text underline>{" "}Edwards Air Force Base</Text> for fuel research. That plane flew 
  <Text strong>{" "}16 hours, 22 minutes</Text>, with 
  <Text type="warning">{" "}10 takeoffs</Text>, 
  <Text type="warning">{" "}69 approaches</Text>, and 
  <Text type="warning">{" "}13 landings</Text>—<Text italic>all without a pilot</Text>. 
  This proves <Text type="danger">remote-controlled planes</Text> were possible 
  <Text strong>{" "}decades before 9/11</Text>.

3. Pre-9/11 Red Flags

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Then, in <Text mark>August 1997</Text>, FEMA’s terrorism response manual showed the{" "}
  <Text strong>World Trade Center</Text> in <Text type="danger">crosshairs</Text>.{" "}
  A year later, in <Text mark>February 1998</Text>, the{" "}
  <Text underline>Global Hawk</Text>, an unmanned aircraft, flew at{" "}
  <Text strong>32,000 feet</Text>—<Text italic>commercial jetliner altitude</Text>.{" "}
  By <Text mark>1999</Text>, <Text strong>NORAD</Text> was running exercises simulating{" "}
  <Text type="danger">hijacked planes crashing</Text> into the{" "}
  <Text strong>World Trade Center</Text> and <Text strong>Pentagon</Text>.{" "}
  In <Text mark>June 2000</Text>, the <Text strong>Department of Justice</Text>{" "}
  released another terrorism manual with the <Text type="danger">WTC in crosshairs</Text>.{" "}
  These aren’t coincidences; they’re <Text type="warning">red flags</Text> screaming that the idea of{" "}
  <Text strong>planes hitting these buildings</Text> was on the government’s radar{" "}
  <Text italic>long before 9/11</Text>.

4. Project for a New American Century


</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  In <Text mark>September 2000</Text>, the{" "}

  <Text underline>Dick Cheney</Text>, <Text underline>Donald Rumsfeld</Text>, <Text underline>Jeb Bush</Text>, and{" "}
  <Text underline>Paul Wolfowitz</Text>, dropped a bombshell report:{" "}
  <Text italic>Rebuilding America’s Defenses</Text>. They said their transformation of{" "}
  <Text strong>U.S. military dominance</Text> would be slow{" "}
  <Text italic>“absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event—like a new Pearl Harbor.”</Text>{" "}
  A year later, <Text type="danger">9/11 happens</Text>, and suddenly their agenda gets a{" "}

<Text underline><Title level={4}>5. Suspicious Military Exercises and Decisions


</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  Then, in <Text mark>October 2000</Text>, the{" "}
  <Text strong>Pentagon</Text> ran <Text code>MASCAL exercises</Text> simulating a{" "}
  <Text underline>Boeing 757 crashing into it</Text>. In{" "}
  <Text mark>April 2001</Text>, <Text strong>NORAD</Text> planned a similar exercise but scrapped it as{" "}
  <Text italic>“too unrealistic.”</Text> <Text type="danger">Really?</Text>{" "}
  Because a few months later, <Text type="danger">it happened</Text>. By{" "}
  <Text mark>June 2001</Text>, the <Text strong>Department of Defense</Text> changed rules so{" "}
  <Text italic>military intervention in hijackings</Text> needed{" "}
  <Text strong>direct approval from the Secretary of Defense</Text>.{" "}
  <Text type="warning">Why tie your own hands before a crisis?</Text>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>6. The Lost City of Iram

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  The Qur’an speaks of a mysterious civilization:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  *“Iram — of lofty pillars. The like of whom was never created in the land.”*<br/>
  *(Qur’an 89:7–8)*
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  For centuries, there was <Text delete>no trace</Text> of such a city.<br/>
  It was dismissed as <Text type="danger">myth</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But in <Text strong>1991</Text>, <Text underline>NASA satellite images</Text> and archaeological teams discovered a buried city in Oman called <Text code>Ubar</Text>, believed to be the city of <Text mark>Iram</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  It was found under the sands of the <Text italic>Rub’ al Khali</Text> (Empty Quarter) — one of the most remote deserts on Earth.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="success">With pillars. With evidence of sudden destruction.</Text><br/>
  <Text strong>Exactly as the Qur’an described.</Text>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>7. The Preservation of the Body in the Sea

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Not just Pharaoh — the Qur’an even describes how a sea splits, a people are saved, and the body of their enemy is preserved.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  That might sound <Text type="warning">mythological</Text> — until modern science weighs in.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Tectonic studies, sea-floor analysis, and Red Sea topography reveal:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" code>
  * A submarine land ridge exists in the Gulf of Suez — potentially enabling a natural crossing.<br/>
  * Simulations suggest a strong east wind (as mentioned in the Bible) could create a temporary land bridge.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>Even more intriguing:</Text> Chariot wheels and human remains have reportedly been found in the Gulf of Aqaba — though these claims remain <Text type="danger">unverified</Text> by official sources.

<Text underline><Title level={4}>8. The House of Qarun (Korah) Sinking
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  The <Text strong>Qur’an</Text> describes <Text mark>Qarun (Korah)</Text> — a man of <Text type="warning">immense wealth</Text>, with treasures that required <Text italic>strong men</Text> to carry:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  <Text italic>“We caused the earth to swallow him and his house.”</Text>
  <br />
  <Text code>(Qur’an 28:81)</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  It was once <Text delete>considered a fable</Text>. But discoveries in Egypt of <Text underline>collapsed underground palaces</Text>, especially in the region of <Text mark>Faiyum</Text>, have lent credence to ancient accounts of buildings that <Text type="danger">literally sank into the earth</Text> — swallowed by sand and seismic shifts.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Even if not <Text italic>conclusive</Text> yet, the <Text strong>Qur’an’s detail</Text> matches <Text type="success">environmental realities</Text> that <Text italic>no one knew at the time</Text>.

<Text underline><Title level={4}>10. The Ark and Mount Judi: A Forgotten Detail That Couldn’t Be Faked
</Title></Text>

 <Paragraph>
  The <Text strong>Bible</Text> says Noah’s Ark came to rest on <Text code>“Mount Ararat”</Text> (Genesis 8:4).<br/>
  This became the dominant belief for centuries — enshrined in Christian, Jewish, and even popular secular culture.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But the <Text strong>Qur’an</Text> doesn’t say <Text delete>“Ararat”</Text>.<br/>
  It doesn’t even mention it once.<br/>
  Instead, the Qur’an says:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  <Text italic>“And it was said, ‘O earth, swallow your water, and O sky, withhold [your rain].’ And the water subsided, and the matter was accomplished, and [the ship] came to rest on al-Jūdiyy.”</Text><br/>
  <Text code>(Surah Hūd 11:44)</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text mark>Mount Judi?</Text><br/>
  For 1400 years, <Text type="danger">critics mocked</Text> this claim.<br/>
  Even Muslims didn’t fully grasp the significance.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But here's the <Text type="warning">striking truth</Text>: <Text strong>Mount Judi is a real place</Text>, and it fits far better with the historical and geographical clues than Ararat.
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>What and Where is Mount Judi?</Title>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>• Mount Judi (Cudi Dagh)</Text> is located in southeastern Turkey, near the Syrian and Iraqi borders — south of Lake Van, not far from ancient Mesopotamia.<br/>
  <Text code>• Arab geographers</Text>, like Al-Mas‘udi (10th century), describe the ark's remains still being shown to travelers on Mount Judi.<br/>
  <Text code>• Josephus</Text>, a 1st-century Jewish historian (in <Text italic>Antiquities of the Jews</Text>), wrote that the ark's remnants were “shown there by the inhabitants to this day” — not in Ararat, but “in the region of the Kurds,” which aligns with Mount Judi.<br/>
  <Text code>• The Syriac Peshitta</Text>, an early Christian Bible translation, also refers to <Text italic>“Qardu”</Text> (related to Judi), not Ararat.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  So, why did the Qur’an name <Text underline>Mount Judi</Text> — a name <Text italic>obscure to most Arabs</Text>, and completely <Text delete>unknown to Christian Europe</Text> — over 1000 years before modern historians confirmed it?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And how did it <Text strong>contradict the popular Biblical claim</Text> at the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), which had <Text italic>no way of being challenged</Text>?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Because the <Text type="success">author of the Qur’an</Text> didn’t copy the Bible.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>He corrected it.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  A man in <Text code>7th-century Arabia</Text>, with <Text type="danger">no access</Text> to ancient Syriac, Jewish geographical disputes, or 1st-century historical texts, gave the more accurate name — one that was buried in obscure traditions and local folklore, and only resurfaced through archaeology and textual history.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="warning">No guesswork.</Text> <Text type="success">No copying.</Text> <Text strong>Just precision.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And once again, <Text mark>the Qur’an gets it right.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  <Text italic>“Will they not then reflect upon the Qur’an? If it had been from other than Allah, they would have found in it many contradictions.”</Text><br/>
  <Text code>(Surah An-Nisā 4:82)</Text>
</Paragraph>


<hr />

<Text underline><Title level={4}>So Ask Yourself: Who Could Have Known?

</Title></Text>

  <Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Who could correct the Bible</Text>, outmatch the historians, and align perfectly with the buried truths of ancient civilizations?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Each of these details represents a <Text type="warning">historical impossibility</Text> for a 7th-century human to know:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>•</Text> Knowing the name of an official and even his job from history lost to all — Greeks, Christians, Romans (<Text mark>Haman</Text>)<br/>
  <Text code>•</Text> <Text strong>Correct use of royal titles</Text> — “King” vs “Pharaoh” in proper historical context<br/>
  <Text code>•</Text> <Text strong>Accurate preservation prophecies</Text> — the body of Pharaoh (“We will preserve your body…” Qur’an 10:92)<br/>
  <Text code>•</Text> <Text strong>True punishment methods</Text> — mention of crucifixion, historically accurate to Pharaoh’s Egypt<br/>
  <Text code>•</Text> <Text strong>Era-correct metallurgy</Text> — mention of iron in the time of Prophet David (Dawud), a detail overlooked by Biblical texts<br/>
  <Text code>•</Text> <Text strong>Mention of ancient lost civilizations</Text> — like Iram of the Pillars and the people of ‘Ad
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And all of them stand in <Text type="danger">contrast to the Bible</Text>, suggesting that the <Text type="success">Qur’an is not copying</Text> — it’s correcting human error with <Text strong>divine knowledge</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Who could have known these details — <Text type="warning">not just ahead of their time</Text>, but <Text italic>against</Text> their time?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  A man who could not read or write?<br/>
  Or the <Text type="success">Author of history itself?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  <Text italic>“This is the Book in which there is no doubt — a guidance for the God-conscious.”</Text><br/>
  <Text code>(Qur’an 2:2)</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  <Text italic>“We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that it is the Truth.”</Text><br/>
  <Text code>(Qur’an 41:53)</Text>
