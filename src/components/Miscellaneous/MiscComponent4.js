Introduction
</Title>

<Paragraph>

  <Text strong>Ladies and gentlemen</Text>, let us confront the <Text mark>undeniable truth</Text>:
  the official narrative of <Text strong>September 11, 2001</Text> is a 
  <Text type="danger">{" "}carefully constructed lie</Text>.<br /><br />

  The evidence, <Text italic>meticulously documented yet not accepted</Text>, reveals a 
  <Text strong>{" "}web of deception</Text> so vast that it implicates the 
  <Text type="danger">{" "}highest levels of power</Text> in the United States government.<br /><br />

  This was <Text strong>not</Text> the work of 19 hijackers with box cutters; 
  it was an <Text underline>inside job</Text>, a 
  <Text strong><Text italic>{" "}false flag operation</Text></Text> designed to manipulate public perception, justify wars, 
  and consolidate control.<br /><br />

  <Text strong>Alright, let’s dive into this.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text code>
    I’m laying out the case, that 9/11 was a lie — a meticulously orchestrated deception that doesn’t hold up under scrutiny.
  </Text><br /><br />

  <Text type="warning">The evidence is overwhelming</Text>, 
  <Text type="danger">the inconsistencies are glaring</Text>, and the official narrative 
  <Text delete> {" "}crumbles</Text> when you look at the facts.
</Paragraph>



<hr />

<Text underline><Title level={4}>1. Operation Northwoods</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>

  <Text italic>
    Let’s start with Operation Northwoods, a chilling precedent from March 13, 1962.
  </Text> The Joint Chiefs of Staff, led by <Text strong>Lyman Lemnitzer</Text>, proposed staging 
  <Text type="danger">{" "}terrorist attacks</Text> around Guantanamo Bay to justify invading Cuba.<br /><br />

  This wasn’t some <Text delete>conspiracy theory</Text>—it’s a 
  <Text mark>{" "}declassified document</Text>.<br /><br />

  They planned <Text type="warning">fake attacks</Text>, 
  staged funerals for <Text italic>mock victims</Text>, and even blowing up a  {" "}
  <Text underline>drone aircraft</Text> disguised as a civilian plane, with federal agents posing as college students. 
  <Text code>Sound familiar?</Text><br /><br />

  The plan was to <Text strong>swap a real plane for a drone</Text>, land the real one at 
  Eglin Air Force Base, and blow up the drone over Cuban waters to fake a crisis.<br /><br />

  <Text type="success">President Kennedy rejected it and fired Lemnitzer</Text>, 
  but this shows the U.S. government was willing to consider 
  <Text strong>{" "}false flag operations</Text> to manipulate public opinion.<br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">
    They were ready to stage a terror attack then — if they thought about it in ’62, why not in 2001?
  </Text>
</Paragraph>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>2.Proof of Remote-Control Capabilities
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Fast forward to <Text mark>December 1, 1984</Text>. NASA crash-landed a  {" "}
  <Text strong>remote-controlled Boeing 720</Text> at 
  <Text underline>{" "}Edwards Air Force Base</Text> for fuel research. That plane flew 
  <Text strong>{" "}16 hours, 22 minutes</Text>, with 
  <Text type="warning">{" "}10 takeoffs</Text>, 
  <Text type="warning">{" "}69 approaches</Text>, and 
  <Text type="warning">{" "}13 landings</Text>—<Text italic>all without a pilot</Text>. 
  This proves <Text type="danger">remote-controlled planes</Text> were possible 
  <Text strong>{" "}decades before 9/11</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>
3. Pre-9/11 Red Flags

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Then, in <Text mark>August 1997</Text>, FEMA’s terrorism response manual showed the{" "}
  <Text strong>World Trade Center</Text> in <Text type="danger">crosshairs</Text>.{" "}
  A year later, in <Text mark>February 1998</Text>, the{" "}
  <Text underline>Global Hawk</Text>, an unmanned aircraft, flew at{" "}
  <Text strong>32,000 feet</Text>—<Text italic>commercial jetliner altitude</Text>.{" "}
  By <Text mark>1999</Text>, <Text strong>NORAD</Text> was running exercises simulating{" "}
  <Text type="danger">hijacked planes crashing</Text> into the{" "}
  <Text strong>World Trade Center</Text> and <Text strong>Pentagon</Text>.{" "}
  In <Text mark>June 2000</Text>, the <Text strong>Department of Justice</Text>{" "}
  released another terrorism manual with the <Text type="danger">WTC in crosshairs</Text>.{" "}
  These aren’t coincidences; they’re <Text type="warning">red flags</Text> screaming that the idea of{" "}
  <Text strong>planes hitting these buildings</Text> was on the government’s radar{" "}
  <Text italic>long before 9/11</Text>.
</Paragraph>

4. Project for a New American Century


</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  In <Text mark>September 2000</Text>, the{" "}
  <Text strong>Project for a New American Century</Text>, a neoconservative think tank with heavyweights like{" "}
  <Text underline>Dick Cheney</Text>, <Text underline>Donald Rumsfeld</Text>, <Text underline>Jeb Bush</Text>, and{" "}
  <Text underline>Paul Wolfowitz</Text>, dropped a bombshell report:{" "}
  <Text italic>Rebuilding America’s Defenses</Text>. They said their transformation of{" "}
  <Text strong>U.S. military dominance</Text> would be slow{" "}
  <Text italic>“absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event—like a new Pearl Harbor.”</Text>{" "}
  A year later, <Text type="danger">9/11 happens</Text>, and suddenly their agenda gets a{" "}
  <Text type="success">green light</Text>. <Text italic>Convenient, right?</Text>
</Paragraph>


<hr />






<Text underline><Title level={4}>5. Suspicious Military Exercises and Decisions


</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  Then, in <Text mark>October 2000</Text>, the{" "}
  <Text strong>Pentagon</Text> ran <Text code>MASCAL exercises</Text> simulating a{" "}
  <Text underline>Boeing 757 crashing into it</Text>. In{" "}
  <Text mark>April 2001</Text>, <Text strong>NORAD</Text> planned a similar exercise but scrapped it as{" "}
  <Text italic>“too unrealistic.”</Text> <Text type="danger">Really?</Text>{" "}
  Because a few months later, <Text type="danger">it happened</Text>. By{" "}
  <Text mark>June 2001</Text>, the <Text strong>Department of Defense</Text> changed rules so{" "}
  <Text italic>military intervention in hijackings</Text> needed{" "}
  <Text strong>direct approval from the Secretary of Defense</Text>.{" "}
  <Text type="warning">Why tie your own hands before a crisis?</Text>
</Paragraph>


<hr />




<Text underline><Title level={4}>6. Strange Events in the Weeks Before 9/11

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  In July 2001, <Text strong>Attorney General John Ashcroft</Text> stopped flying commercial jets due to an FBI threat assessment. 
  <Text mark>{" "}Why wasn’t the public warned?</Text> 

  On July 4, 2001, <Text strong>Osama bin Laden</Text>, wanted since 1998, was reportedly at the <Text underline>American Hospital in Dubai</Text>, visited by a <Text strong>CIA chief</Text>. 
  <Text mark>If we knew where he was, why wasn’t he arrested?</Text>

  <br /><br />

  On July 24, 2001, <Text strong>Larry Silverstein</Text> leased the entire <Text underline>World Trade Center complex</Text> for <Text code>$3.2 billion</Text>, including a 
  <Text code>$3.5 billion</Text> insurance policy specifically covering terrorism. 

  <Text italic>{" "}Six weeks later, the towers are gone</Text>, and he’s demanding <Text code>$7.2 billion</Text>, claiming each plane was a separate attack. 
  He settled for <Text code>$2.2 billion</Text> — <Text strong>still a massive payout</Text>. 

  <Text mark>{" "}Suspicious timing, no?</Text>
</Paragraph>


<hr />




<Text underline><Title level={4}>7. Stock Market Warnings

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Then we get to <Text strong>September 6, 2001</Text>.{" "}
  A staggering <Text code>3,150</Text> put options were placed on <Text strong>United Airlines</Text> stock—bets it would plummet—
  <Text mark>four times the daily average</Text>.{" "}
  That same day, <Text mark>bomb-sniffing dogs were pulled from the WTC</Text>, and security guards ended <Text underline>two weeks of 12-hour shifts</Text>.{" "}
  On <Text strong>September 7</Text>, <Text code>2,729</Text> put options hit <Text strong>Boeing</Text> stock,{" "}
  <Text mark>five times the norm</Text>.{" "}
  On <Text strong>September 10</Text>, <Text code>4,516</Text> put options were placed on <Text strong>American Airlines</Text>—
  <Text mark>11 times the average</Text>.{" "}
  <Text type="danger">Someone knew something was coming</Text>.
</Paragraph>


<hr />



<Text underline><Title level={4}>8. More Warnings
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown</Text> got a call warning him <Text mark>not to fly the next day</Text>.{" "}
  In Pakistan, a hospital replaced its urologists with a <Text mark>special team to treat Osama bin Laden</Text>,{" "}
  who was <Text italic>“carefully escorted”</Text> in.{" "}
  <Text type="warning">The stage was set.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<hr />


<Text underline><Title level={4}>9. September 11, 2001 – War Games and Confusion
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>*The National Reconnaissance Office was running an exercise where a corporate jet crashes into their building.</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>NORAD was in the middle of multiple exercises, including </Text>
  <Text code>Vigilant Guardian</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>(simulating a crisis to air defenses) and </Text>
  <Text code>Northern Vigilance</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>(moving jets to Canada and Alaska for a fake Russian threat).</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>Three F-16s from Andrews Air Force Base, just 15 miles from the Pentagon, were sent 180 miles away for a training mission,</Text>{" "}
  <Text type="warning">leaving only 14 jets to defend the entire U.S. airspace</Text>.{" "}
  <Text italic>When Boston Center reported a hijacked plane heading for New York, air traffic controllers had to ask,</Text>{" "}
  <Text code>“Is this real-world or exercise?”</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>That’s how chaotic it was—by design.*</Text>{" "}
  <Text type="danger">(They intentionally made it confusing even for their own military to react in time)</Text>
</Paragraph>

<hr />

<Text underline><Title level={4}>10. The Pentagon: Inconsistencies and Impossibilities
</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  <Text type="warning">Let’s tackle the Pentagon first</Text>, because the <Text type="danger">official story about Flight 77 is a joke</Text>.{" "}
  They say <Text strong>Hani Hanjour</Text>, a guy who <Text italic>could barely fly a Cessna 172</Text>,{" "}
  executed a <Text mark>330-degree turn at 530 mph</Text>, descending <Text mark>7,000 feet in two and a half minutes</Text> to hit the Pentagon’s ground floor.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Marcel Bernard</Text>, chief flight instructor at Freeway Airport, said Hanjour was{" "}
  <Text type="danger">a below-average pilot with poor English</Text> and <Text italic>struggled to control a small plane</Text>.{" "}
  Yet we’re supposed to believe he pulled off a maneuver that would <Text underline>make Top Gun pilots jealous</Text>?{" "}
  Air traffic controllers at Dulles thought it was a <Text code>military plane</Text>, not a commercial jet.{" "}
  Eyewitnesses described a <Text mark>plane with no windows</Text>, a <Text mark>blue circular logo</Text>,{" "}
  or even a <Text mark>military helicopter</Text>—not a <Text code>Boeing 757</Text>.*  
</Paragraph>


<Title level={4}>Missing Wreckage at the Pentagon</Title>

<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>The physical evidence is even worse.</Text>{" "}
  Five light poles were supposedly knocked out by Flight 77, but in 2004, a private jet clipping one pole lost its wing and crashed.{" "}
  Flight 77’s wings were unscathed, and the poles <Text mark>“popped out” of the ground like magic</Text>.{" "}
  The Pentagon lawn was pristine—<Text strong>no skid marks, no debris</Text>.{" "}
  The official explanation? <Text type="danger">The plane vaporized due to jet fuel heat.</Text>{" "}
  A <Text code>Boeing 757</Text>, 155 feet long, 44 feet high, 124-foot wingspan, weighing 100 tons, disappeared into a 16-foot hole.{" "}
  No wing marks, no engine imprints, no damage to windows or cable spools right next to the hole.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Inside, another 16-foot hole was found three rings deep, through 9 feet of steel-reinforced concrete.{" "}
  The nose of a 757, made of lightweight carbon, <Text italic>couldn’t do that</Text>.{" "}
  A <Text mark>cruise missile</Text>, like the one that hit Slobodan Milosevic’s residence in Belgrade, <Text type="danger">could</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>Contradictions in the Pentagon Explosion</Title>

<Paragraph>
  They claim the jet fuel fire was so hot it vaporized the plane, yet investigators identified 184 of 189 bodies using DNA.{" "}
  Titanium, used in plane engines, melts at 1,688°C; jet fuel burns at 1,120°C max, and only briefly.{" "}
  <Text mark>Two engines, each 6 tons, should’ve been found intact.</Text> Instead, we got a 3-foot turbojet engine and a piece of fuselage that wasn’t singed or scratched.{" "}
  A diffuser case was found, but <Text strong>it didn’t match a 757’s design</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Eyewitnesses reported a <Text mark>shockwave</Text>, a <Text mark>bright silvery flash</Text>, and the smell of <Text code>cordite</Text>—a military explosive, not jet fuel.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Two planes were seen after the crash: a <Text code>C-130</Text> and an <Text code>unmarked white jet</Text> circling D.C.{" "}
  Surveillance tapes from a gas station, Sheraton Hotel, and Virginia DOT were confiscated by the FBI within minutes, and they’ve only released five blurry frames that show no 757.{" "}
  The Pentagon was hit in the only section renovated to withstand such an attack, and <Text strong>Rumsfeld was safely on the opposite side</Text>.{" "}
  <Text type="danger">If they’ve got nothing to hide, why won’t they release the tapes?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>Strange Evidence from the Twin Towers</Title>

<Paragraph>
  Firefighters described the North Tower’s lobby as looking like <Text italic>“a bomb had exploded.”</Text>{" "}
  Survivor William Rodriguez heard <Text italic>“massive explosions”</Text> in the basement before the plane hit.{" "}
  CNN, BBC, and other live footage captured explosions. Molten steel poured out the South Tower minutes before collapse—jet fuel fires can’t melt steel.{" "}
  <Text mark>Thermite</Text>, however, can. Steven Jones, physics professor at BYU, found <Text strong>traces of thermite and iron microspheres</Text> in WTC dust samples.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text mark>Thermite burns at 4,000°F</Text> and cuts through steel like butter.{" "}
  Why was molten steel found <Text underline>weeks later</Text> in the rubble?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Then there’s <Text code>Building 7</Text>. Never hit by a plane. Small fires. Collapsed symmetrically in 6 seconds.{" "}
  Larry Silverstein said on PBS, <Text italic>“We decided to pull it.”</Text> “Pull” is demolition lingo.{" "}
  FEMA’s report said the collapse had <Text italic>“low probability of occurrence.”</Text>{" "}
  NIST took seven years to explain it—blaming fire.{" "}
  <Text mark>BBC and CNN reported the collapse before it happened.</Text>{" "}
  <Text type="danger">How did they know?</Text>
  (Literal video evidence of them already claiming the tower has fallen when it's right behind them still standing, their timing went off , falsehood by nature looks unreal even if you try too hard to make it real)
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>Flight 93</Title>

<Paragraph>
  The official story says it crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania after passengers fought back.{" "}
  But the crash site had <Text strong>no plane wreckage</Text>. No fuselage, no bodies, no engines—just a smoldering hole.{" "}
  Coroner Wallace Miller said, <Text italic>“I stopped being a coroner after about 20 minutes because there were no bodies.”</Text>{" "}
  Debris was found eight miles away.{" "}
  <Text type="danger">How does a plane disintegrate on impact and scatter parts miles out?</Text>{" "}
  Eyewitnesses reported an <Text mark>explosion in the air</Text>. Was it shot down?
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>Flight 175</Title>

<Paragraph>
  The plane that hit the South Tower. Footage shows <Text mark>something under its fuselage</Text>—possibly a pod.{" "}
  A <Text mark>bright flash occurs before impact</Text>.{" "}
  <Text strong>Military planes</Text> often have such features—not commercial jets.{" "}
  Some argue it was <Text code>digital fakery</Text>, or that the footage was tampered with.{" "}
  <Text type="danger">Why the anomalies?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>The Hijackers</Title>

<Paragraph>
  The FBI identified 19 men. Yet <Text strong>several turned up alive</Text>—living in Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Tunisia.{" "}
  Waleed al-Shehri was interviewed by the BBC. Abdulaziz al-Omari claimed his identity was stolen.{" "}
  The FBI <Text underline>never revised their list</Text>.{" "}
  <Text type="danger">If the identities are wrong, what else is?</Text> (9 of the supposed dead terrorists turned out to be normal citizens who all got their passports stolen)
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>Bin Laden and the Escape</Title>

<Paragraph>
  Initially denied involvement. Said in a 2001 interview: <Text italic>“I have already said that I am not involved.”</Text>{" "}
  Later videos emerged claiming responsibility—yet the man <Text mark>looks different</Text>. Different nose, different facial features.{" "}
  <Text code>CIA experts</Text> questioned their authenticity.{" "}
  <Text type="danger">Why not capture him at Tora Bora in December 2001?</Text> Why let him escape?
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>NORAD’s Failure</Title>

<Paragraph>
  Planes flew off-course for 90 minutes. Interceptors scrambled too late. Standard protocol ignored.{" "}
  On July 26, 2001, <Text code>Dick Cheney</Text> took control of NORAD responses.{" "}
  A 2004 memo showed Cheney was <Text strong>in command during the attacks</Text>.{" "}
  <Text type="danger">Why wasn’t he held accountable?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>The Commission</Title>

<Paragraph>
  The 9/11 Commission was underfunded—just <Text code>$15 million</Text>. Compare that to <Text code>$100 million</Text> for the Clinton-Lewinsky probe.{" "}
  Witnesses like Sibel Edmonds and William Rodriguez were ignored.{" "}
  Evidence was omitted. Families demanded answers—many never came.
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>Insurance Profits</Title>

<Paragraph>
  Larry Silverstein insured the towers against terrorism six weeks before 9/11.{" "}
  After the attacks, he filed <Text strong>two claims</Text>—arguing each plane was a separate event.{" "}
  He walked away with <Text code>$4.6 billion</Text>.{" "}
  <Text type="danger">What a return.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Title level={4}>The Aftermath</Title>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>The Patriot Act</Text> signed 45 days later—hundreds of pages long.{" "}
  <Text type="danger">Who wrote it so fast?</Text>{" "}
  Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq followed. The military-industrial complex boomed. Defense stocks soared.{" "}
  Halliburton made billions.{" "}
  <Text type="danger">The cost?</Text> Millions of lives, lost freedoms, endless war.{" "}
  Only one side gained through this , we all know who, at the cost of millions of lives in Iraq, Afghanistan, and so on.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="warning">This isn’t conspiracy—it’s documented, sourced, and undeniable.</Text>{" "}
  The official narrative isn’t just flawed—it’s impossible.{" "}
  The deeper you look, the more it falls apart.{" "}
  <Text type="danger">9/11 was not just a tragedy. It was a turning point.</Text> A lie so big, it redefined our world.
</Paragraph>

<hr />

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Question everything.</Text>{" "}
  <Text italic>Dig deeper.</Text>{" "}
  <Text underline>Don't stop at headlines.</Text>{" "}
  The truth is buried—
