        <Text underline><Title level={2}>Eradicate Religion because this is the major source of violence - Brutal Refutation </Title></Text>
        <Title level={4}>Introduction</Title>

<Paragraph>
  A growing chorus—particularly among some <Text type="warning">atheists and secular humanists</Text>—has popularized the claim that <Text strong>“religion is the major source of violence in the world.”</Text> This argument, though emotionally persuasive for some, is often used to justify calls to <Text type="danger">“eradicate religion from the earth”</Text>, under the belief that such an act would usher in a utopian age of peace, rationality, and scientific enlightenment.
  <br /><br />
  However, this assertion is not only <Text type="warning">historically inaccurate</Text> but also <Text strong>logically inconsistent</Text>. The narrative overlooks the atrocities committed by <Text mark>irreligious regimes</Text> and the ethical failures of ideologies untethered from spiritual or moral constraints. From Stalinist purges to the horrors of the Khmer Rouge, the bloodshed wrought by <Text italic>atheistic and secularist ideologies</Text> often dwarfs religious conflicts in both scale and brutality.
  <br /><br />
  This article seeks to <Text underline>critically dismantle</Text> the claim that religion is the root cause of global violence. It will examine:
  <ul>
    <li><Text code>The historical record of both religious and secular violence</Text></li>
    <li><Text code>The moral consequences of ideologies without divine accountability</Text></li>
    <li><Text code>The role of science when divorced from ethical frameworks</Text></li>
  </ul>
  <Text italic>and lot more spicy arguments........</Text>
  <br />
  Finally, this article will present <Text type="success">Islam</Text> not merely as a religion, but as a <Text mark>comprehensive moral and social system</Text> — one with the capacity to restore justice, balance, and peace in an increasingly fragmented and volatile world.
</Paragraph>


<hr />

<Text underline><Title level={4}>1. The Fallacy of Correlation Equals Causation</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  First, let's <Text strong>dismantle the myth</Text> that religion is inherently violent. Critics frequently reference historical episodes like the <Text mark>Crusades</Text>, modern <Text type="danger">jihadi terrorism</Text>, or <Text type="warning">sectarian conflicts</Text> as definitive proof. However, using a handful of examples to indict all religion is intellectually shallow and <Text italic>methodologically flawed</Text>. Most of these so-called "religious wars" were <Text strong>primarily political</Text> in nature, with religion serving as a convenient banner rather than the root cause.
  <br /><br />
  Take the <Text code>Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648)</Text>, often cited as a religious clash between Catholics and Protestants. A deeper analysis reveals it was a struggle for <Text underline>territory, influence, and state power</Text> in Europe. Religion was the pretext, not the engine. This pattern repeats across history, where power, not piety, fuels conflict.
  <br /><br />
  Moreover, the foundational teachings of major world religions—including <Text type="success">Islam</Text>—promote <Text strong>ethical behavior, social harmony, and compassion</Text>. The Quran repeatedly calls for justice, mercy, and peace. When individuals commit violence in the name of religion, it is a <Text type="danger">perversion of sacred texts</Text>, not a faithful application. The blame lies not with the <Text italic>divine message</Text>, but with those who <Text type="danger">represent</Text> <Text mark>misrepresent</Text> it.
</Paragraph>


<Text underline><Title level={4}>2. The Bloody Legacy of Atheist and Secular Regimes</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  If religion is to be blamed for violence, then one must <Text strong>equally examine</Text> the legacy of <Text type="danger">atheistic regimes</Text>—many of which rank among the most brutal in human history. Consider the following cases:
  <br /><br />
  <Text underline><Text mark>A{" ) "} Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union:</Text></Text> Over <Text strong>20 million deaths</Text> from purges, gulags, forced famines, and executions. Stalin promoted <Text code>state atheism</Text>, destroyed religious institutions, and executed clergy. 
  <br /><br />
  <Text underline><Text mark>B{" ) "}Mao Zedong’s China:</Text></Text> An estimated <Text strong>45–70 million people</Text> died during the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution. Religion was suppressed, and science was twisted into ideological dogma.
  <br /><br />
  <Text underline><Text mark>C{" ) "}Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge:</Text></Text> Nearly <Text strong>2 million people</Text> died under an atheist communist regime that <Text type="danger">discouraged</Text> <Text underline>banned</Text> religion, demolished temples, and murdered monks.
  <br /><br />
  <Text underline><Text mark>D{" ) "}North Korea:</Text></Text> A totalitarian atheist regime where <Text type="warning">religion is outlawed</Text> and dissenters are imprisoned, tortured, or killed under a cult of personality.
  <br /><br />
  The argument doesn’t stop there. Consider the <Text type="danger">deadly consequences of scientific progress</Text> when stripped of ethical or spiritual guidance:
  <ul>
    <li><Text strong>Atomic bombings</Text> of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: Over <Text type="danger">200,000 civilians</Text> killed—justified through “rational” military strategy, not faith.</li>
    <li><Text strong>Eugenics and forced sterilization:</Text> In Nazi Germany and early 20th-century USA, <Text italic>scientific racism</Text> was used to justify atrocities.</li>
    <li><Text strong>Chemical weapons, drone warfare, and mass surveillance:</Text> Modern tools of destruction and control, all created and used by secular powers, not religious mandates.</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <Text strong>Clearly, removing religion does not eliminate violence</Text>; it merely <Text type="warning">removes the ethical guardrails</Text> that might otherwise prevent it. History shows that ideologies—religious or not—become dangerous when <Text underline>divorced from compassion, accountability, and moral restraint</Text>.
</Paragraph>




<Text underline><Title level={4}>3. The Incomplete Morality of Secular Humanism</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Secular humanism</Text>, often proposed as a rational and ethical alternative to religion, <Text type="warning">fails on two critical fronts</Text>:
  <br /><br />
  <Text underline><Text mark>1. It cannot ground morality objectively.</Text></Text><br />
  If morality is merely a human invention, then <Text type="danger">there is no absolute right or wrong</Text>. Acts like genocide, torture, or rape are no longer universally condemned—they become <Text italic>subjective matters</Text>, judged only by cultural norms or changing laws. Without an external, unchanging moral anchor, ethics float on the tides of opinion and power.
  <br /><br />
  <Text underline><Text mark>2. It lacks true accountability.</Text></Text><br />
  In a worldview without a Creator—<Text code>no divine Judge, no eternal justice</Text>—there is no one to hold individuals accountable beyond the imperfect systems of man. <Text italic>Who watches the watchmen?</Text> Without fear of ultimate consequence or hope for divine reward, <Text type="warning">the temptation for tyranny and corruption intensifies</Text>.
  <br /><br />
  <Text strong>Religion, particularly Islam</Text>, offers both <Text underline>objective morality</Text> and <Text underline>cosmic accountability</Text>—foundations essential to building a just and humane society.
</Paragraph>



<Text underline><Title level={4}>4. Islam: A Divine System for Justice and Peace</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Unlike many <Text italic>secular ideologies</Text>, <Text strong>Islam offers a comprehensive, timeless, and universal moral code</Text>. Its teachings address every aspect of life—<Text underline>personal conduct</Text>, <Text underline>economic fairness</Text>, <Text underline>social responsibility</Text>, and <Text underline>governance</Text>—forming a framework that balances individual rights with collective well-being.
  <br /><br />
  <Text type="success">Justice is central to Islam:</Text> <Text mark>“Indeed, Allah commands justice and good conduct…”</Text> (Qur’an 16:90)
  <br />
  <Text type="success">The sanctity of life:</Text> <Text mark>“Whoever kills a soul... it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one—it is as if he had saved mankind entirely.”</Text> (Qur’an 5:32)
  <br />
  <Text type="success">Ethical warfare:</Text> <Text mark>“Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors.”</Text> (Qur’an 2:190)
  <br /><br />
  <Text strong>Islam also safeguards social harmony:</Text> it ensures the rights of <Text mark>the poor, orphans, neighbors</Text>, and even <Text mark>animals</Text>. Zakat (obligatory charity) is not just encouraged—it’s a <Text code>pillar of the faith</Text>, making care for others a religious duty.
  <br /><br />
  <Text italic>Historically, Islamic civilization led the world</Text> in <Text underline>peaceful coexistence, scientific innovation</Text>, and <Text underline>interfaith tolerance</Text>. Jews and Christians <Text type="success">flourished</Text> under Islamic rule in <Text mark>Muslim Spain, Ottoman Turkey, and Abbasid Baghdad</Text>—often enjoying more rights and respect than they did under Christian empires of the same era.
</Paragraph>



<Text underline><Title level={4}>5. Trolls Cry About Jihad but Stay Silent on Western Imperialism</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  They <Text italic>condemn</Text> Islam as violent, yet fall <Text type="warning">eerily silent</Text> when confronted with the brutal realities of secular violence:
  <br /><br />
  • <Text mark>Colonialism</Text> erased entire civilizations and enslaved millions under the banner of “civilization.”<br />
  • <Text mark>America’s illegal wars</Text> in Iraq and Afghanistan—waged on proven lies—left over <Text strong>one million Muslims dead</Text>.<br />
  • <Text mark>Israel’s occupation and ethnic cleansing</Text> of Palestine, carried out with <Text underline>Western funding, weapons, and silence</Text>.
  <br /><br />
  Where is their outrage now? <Text code>Where are their viral tweets and protest hashtags?</Text>
  <br /><br />
  <Text type="danger">This isn’t about peace—it’s about propaganda.</Text> It’s about <Text strong>demonizing religion</Text>, especially Islam, while <Text type="danger">cheering drone strikes and apartheid walls</Text>—as long as they’re delivered by men in suits in Washington or Tel Aviv.
</Paragraph>


<Text underline><Title level={4}>6. "Religion is Oppressive" – Says the Porn-Addicted, Depressed Trolls</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  Trolls love to yell: <Text code>"Islam oppresses women!"</Text><br /><br />
  
  Meanwhile, in their so-called "liberated" societies:
  <br /><br />
  • <Text type="warning">OnlyFans is glorified</Text>, while <Text strong>teen girls are exploited</Text> and trafficked in record numbers.<br />
  • Porn—now a multibillion-dollar industry—<Text mark>rewires brains, destroys relationships</Text>, and fuels rape culture, yet modesty is the problem?<br />
  • They <Text type="danger">mock hijab</Text> as “oppression,” but <Text underline>worship surgically-altered influencers</Text> who live off selling their bodies to strangers for likes and money.<br />
  • They claim to fight for “women’s rights,” yet <Text type="danger">protect predators in Hollywood, government, and tech</Text> as long as they're “progressive.”<br />
  • They cry “my body, my choice,” yet let <Text italic>capitalism commodify every inch of a woman’s body</Text> for profit.<br /><br />

  <Text type="success">Islam defends dignity, honor, and identity—not oppression.</Text><br />
  Your so-called “freedom” is just <Text strong>sexual slavery wrapped in glitter, marketed by billionaires</Text> who don’t care if your daughters break.<br /><br />

  <Text code>Hijab is not the enemy. Hypocrisy is.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>7. “We Believe in Science” – But Can't Define a Woman or Tell Right from Wrong
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  They boast, <Text code>"We believe in facts and science!"</Text> — until it’s inconvenient:
  <br /><br />
  • <Text strong>Biology says there are two genders</Text> — suddenly, <Text type="warning">science is transphobic?</Text><br />
  • A baby in the womb has a heartbeat — but they call it <Text italic>"just a clump of cells."</Text><br />
  • They chant <Text code>"morality is subjective"</Text>, then scream <Text type="danger">"Hitler was evil!"</Text> — <Text underline>by what standard?</Text><br /><br />
  
  Their “truth” changes with hashtags, trends, and Twitter mobs. <Text mark>Feelings become facts, and facts get canceled.</Text><br /><br />
  
  <Text type="success">Islam gives truth that doesn’t bend to culture, politics, or popularity.</Text> Their worldview? A house of cards built on vibes.
</Paragraph>


<Text underline><Title level={4}>8. Modern Atheist Nations: Depressed, Suicidal, Nihilistic
</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  They say:<br /><br />

  <Text italic>“There’s no absolute truth.”</Text><br />
  <Text italic>“Morals are just human inventions.”</Text><br />
  <Text italic>“We only believe what’s provable.”</Text><br /><br />

  But they crumble the moment you ask:<br /><br />

  • <Text strong>Is your claim “no absolute truth”... absolutely true?</Text><br />
  • <Text strong>If morals are invented, what makes rape or genocide objectively wrong?</Text><br />
  • <Text strong>Can you prove love, loyalty, or consciousness under a microscope?</Text><br /><br />

  Their worldview <Text type="warning">collapses like a house of cards</Text>—a <Text type="danger">Reddit-tier meme disguised as philosophy</Text>.<br /><br />

  They claim godlessness brings peace and progress. So, explain this:<br /><br />

  <Text strong>Japan</Text> – Among the most atheist nations, yet suicide is a cultural norm, marriage is vanishing, and youth isolation is endemic.<br />
  <Text strong>Scandinavia</Text> – Wealthy, yes. But plagued by depression, loneliness, and record-high antidepressant use.<br />
  <Text strong>USA & UK</Text> – Mental health collapse, school shootings, and broken homes.<br /><br />

  <Text mark>They removed God… and created spiritual deserts</Text> where people <Text type="secondary" italic>die inside long before they die outside</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>9.  Islamophobia is the Last Accepted Racism

</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  They wouldn’t dare insult <Text strong>Judaism</Text> or <Text strong>Sikhism</Text>. But <Text strong>Islam</Text>? That’s their favorite punching bag.<br /><br />

  Why? Because we don’t kneel to their <Text type="warning">rainbow idols</Text>, <Text type="danger">imperial war machines</Text>, or <Text type="danger">OnlyFans culture</Text>.<br /><br />

  They call Muslims “barbaric,” yet:<br />
  • We have <Text mark>lower crime rates</Text>.<br />
  • <Text strong>Fathers actually stay in the home</Text>.<br />
  • We build <Text underline>real community</Text>—not TikTok clout farms and hookup apps. 
We have <Text strong>Real community in masjids</Text>, not <Text type="danger">empty therapy talk</Text>
<br /><br />

  They say we’re violent?<br />
  <Text type="success">No, we’re just not spiritually neutered.</Text><br />
  <Text strong>We don't beg for validation. We live with purpose. We die with honor.</Text><br /><br />

  While they chase dopamine, we chase Jannah.<br />
  While they worship desires, we worship the Creator.<br />
  While they collapse into nihilism, we rise in sujood.<br /><br />

  <Text code>The truth is—they don’t hate Islam because it’s violent.</Text><br />
  <Text code>They hate it because it’s unbreakable.</Text>
</Paragraph>



<Text underline><Title level={4}>10. Final Blow: The Lion Doesn’t Answer to Crippled Dogs
</Title></Text>
 <Paragraph>
    <Text type="warning" strong>Trolls bark online</Text> with edgy quotes and memes.
    <br />
    But they have <Text type="danger">no philosophy</Text>. <Text type="danger">No ethics</Text>. <Text type="danger">No hope</Text>.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    We have the <Text mark>Qur’an</Text>, the <Text mark>Sunnah</Text>, <Text strong>1400 years of legacy</Text>, and a <Text underline>Lord who never sleeps</Text>.
    <br />
    Let them mock. On the <Text type="danger">Day of Judgment</Text>, <Text type="danger">laughter dies</Text>, and <Text strong>truth roars</Text>.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text type="success" strong>The Ummah rises.</Text> <Text type="success" strong>The Ummah remembers.</Text> And <Text strong>Islam</Text>? <Text code>Still undefeated</Text>.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text type="danger" strong>Fatality.</Text>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    So, to those who chant: <Text italic>“Eradicate religion to end violence”</Text>—I say this:
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    You seek to <Text type="danger">kill the physician</Text> to cure the disease.
    <br />
    You aim to <Text type="danger">burn the law books</Text> because criminals break the law.
    <br />
    <Text type="warning">History has already shown us the bloodbaths</Text> that come when <Text strong>God is removed from the equation</Text>.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    It is not religion, but <Text type="danger" strong>godlessness</Text>, that has led humanity into its <Text italic>darkest hours</Text>.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    And if there is any force today that can rise above <Text underline>race</Text>, <Text underline>nationalism</Text>, and <Text underline>class</Text> to unite hearts under justice—
    <br />
    it is not <Text type="danger">atheism</Text>. It is <Text mark>Islam</Text>.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <Text strong>Opponent's logic:</Text> <Text code>Exposed</Text>.
    <br />
    <Text strong>Their data:</Text> <Text code>Dismantled</Text>.
    <br />
    <Text strong>Their dream of utopia without God:</Text> <Text code>Crushed by reality</Text>.
    <br />
    <Text strong>Finishing move:</Text> <Text code>Delivered</Text>.
  </Paragraph>
