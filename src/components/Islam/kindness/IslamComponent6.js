🐑 Introduction: The Misunderstood Ritual


</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>

Every year during <Text strong>Eid al-Adha</Text>, <Text mark>Muslims across the world</Text> perform the ritual of animal sacrifice (<Text italic>Qurbani</Text>) to commemorate the legacy of <Text underline>Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) عليه السلام</Text> — who showed <Text strong>ultimate submission to God</Text> by being ready to sacrifice his own son <Text underline>Ishmael عليه السلام</Text>.

This sacrifice is:

<Text type="success"> {" "}Deeply symbolic, not just cultural.</Text>

<Text type="warning">{" "}Regulated by mercy and compassion, not bloodlust.</Text>

<Text strong>{" "}A charitable act that feeds millions of poor.</Text>

{" "}And yet, every year, <Text type="danger">not a single one is spared</Text> when the ritual is attacked, mocked, and demonized by:

<Text code>🐄 Vegan activists</Text>, claiming it's cruelty.

<Text code>🕉️ Hindu nationalists</Text>, accusing Muslims of barbarism.

<Text code>📰 Western liberals and media</Text>, painting it as savage.

Even <Text italic>some Christians</Text>, forgetting their own past of temple sacrifices.

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
These criticisms reek of ignorance, hypocrisy, and selective morality.
</Paragraph>

Let’s <Text strong>destroy these double standards</Text> once and for all. And yeah next time, if someone <Text type="danger">dares</Text> criticizing Eid, <Text strong>SHOW THIS ARTICLE AS A TOOL FOR EXORCISM OF THE CRITICS!</Text>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>🌱 1. Refuting Vegan and Animal Rights Criticism: Hypocrisy Exposed</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>Let’s get real:</Title>

  <Text mark>
    &gt; If you eat burgers, wear leather, or enjoy eggs and milk — don’t lecture Muslims about “animal cruelty.”
  </Text>

  <Text strong>{" "}Muslims are not suddenly harming animals on Eid.</Text> Islam requires: {" "}

  <Text underline>Animals to be fed, rested, and not mistreated.</Text>{" "}

  <Text underline>Slaughter to be quick and painless, avoiding torture.</Text>{" "}

  <Text underline>Parts of meat to be distributed to the poor, not wasted.</Text>{" "}

  <Text strong>This isn’t a blood ritual or savagery.</Text> It’s a <Text italic>divine command</Text> rooted in <Text mark>compassion, gratitude, and charity</Text> — a ritual that:

  <Text type="success">{" "}Reminds us of our dependence on Allah,</Text>

  <Text type="warning">{" "}Breaks the ego of the privileged,</Text>

  <Text type="success">{" "}And feeds the hungry, not fills freezers for fun.</Text>

  <Title level={4}>Meanwhile:</Title>

  <Text type="danger">In the West, industrial meat farming involves electrocuting, confining, and force-feeding animals, stacking them in crates, clipping beaks, snapping bones during transportation, and gassing them in slaughterhouses.</Text>

  {" "}<Text mark>Over 150 million animals are killed every single day globally — not for God, not for reflection, not for charity, but just for fast food, greasy profits, and gluttony.</Text>

  <Text type="warning">{" "}And let’s not ignore the brutal irony:</Text> <Text type="danger">Many vegans loudly support abortion-on-demand, where the unborn feel pain — but they scream about Muslims sacrificing lambs for Eid charity.</Text> <Text strong>That's hypocrisy dipped in soy milk.</Text>

  <Title level={4}>Qurbani is mercy, not cruelty.</Title>
  <Text strong>It connects the eater to the Creator, and to the animal itself.</Text> It’s not mindless consumption — it’s a ritual of <Text underline>reflection, submission, and responsibility.</Text>

  <Title level={4}>🐐 Islam’s Mercy Toward Animals: Not Just Eid — Always</Title>

  <Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
    Islam is light-years ahead of modern “animal rights” slogans when it comes to real compassion. Unlike secular ethics, which shift with opinion polls, Islamic law has timeless rulings grounded in the sacredness of life — even animal life.
  </Paragraph>

  <Title level={4}>Here are examples that demolish the myth that Islam promotes cruelty:</Title>

  <Text strong>🔹 The Prophet ﷺ said:</Text>

  <Text mark>
    &gt; “Verily, Allah has prescribed excellence in everything. If you kill, kill well. If you slaughter, slaughter well. Let one of you sharpen his blade and spare suffering to the animal.”  
    <Text strong>( Proof - Sahih Muslim 1955)</Text>
  </Text>
    <br /> <br />
  <Text strong>This isn't optional. It’s a command.</Text> And it’s centuries ahead of modern animal welfare guidelines.
<br /> <br />
  <Text strong>🔹 Another Hadith:</Text>

  <Text mark>
    &gt; “Do not sharpen your knife in front of the animal. Do you want to kill it twice?”  
    (al-Bayhaqi, Shu’ab al-Iman)
  </Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text italic>Imagine that.</Text> Over 1400 years ago, Islam forbade psychological stress to animals — even for seconds before slaughter. While in today’s meat factories, animals see and hear others dying, screaming in fear before being stunned or sliced by conveyor belts.
<br /> <br />
  <Text strong>🔹 A woman was condemned to Hell because she locked up a cat until it died:</Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text mark>
    &gt; “The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "A woman entered the (Hell) Fire because of a cat which she had tied, neither giving it food nor setting it free to eat from the vermin of the earth. ".”  
    <Text strong>( Proof - Sahih Bukhari 3318)</Text>
  </Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text mark>
    &gt; "Nafi’ reported from ‘Abdullah that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: A woman was punished because she had kept a cat tied until it died, and (as a punishment of this offence) she was thrown into the Hell. She had not provided it with food, or drink, and had not freed her so that she could eat the insects of the earth."  
    <Text strong>( Proof - Sahih Muslim Book 26, Hadith Number 5570 )</Text>
  </Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text type="danger">This shows that cruelty to even one animal, if done intentionally and without mercy, is enough to risk damnation.</Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text strong>🔹 Conversely, a Prostitute was forgiven by Allah for giving water to a thirsty dog:</Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text mark>
    &gt; “Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "A prostitute was forgiven by Allah, because, passing by a panting dog near a well and seeing that the dog was about to die of thirst, she took off her shoe, and tying it with her head-cover she drew out some water for it. So, Allah forgave her because of that."”  
    <Text strong>( Proof - Sahih Bukhari 3321)</Text>
  </Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text type="success">Let that sink in:</Text> <Text italic>an act of mercy to a dog — an animal that many societies considered impure — earned a sinner forgiveness from the Most High.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>🛑 Vegan Hypocrisy and the Religion of Emotional Extremism</Title>

  <Text italic>Some vegans and animal rights activists claim the moral high ground.</Text> But let's ask:

  {" "}<Text mark>Do they protest fast food chains with the same energy they attack Muslims?</Text>

  {" "}<Text underline>Do they stop buying iPhones, knowing animal testing and human labor exploitation are involved?</Text>

  {" "}<Text mark>Why don’t they march against the scientific labs that torture animals daily, or designer industries that skin animals alive for fashion?</Text>

  {" "}<Text strong>No. Because this isn’t about animals.</Text>  
  {" "}It’s about <Text type="warning">virtue signaling, cultural supremacy, and Islamophobia dressed as ethics.</Text>

  {" "}<Text type="danger">They don’t care about the sheep.</Text> They care about <Text underline>demonizing the people who say “Bismillah” before slaughter.</Text>

  <Title level={4}>⚖ Islam vs Secular Ethics: Who Really Cares?</Title>

  <Text italic>Modern secular ethics say:</Text>

  <Text mark>
    &gt; “As long as it’s efficient, mass-scale animal death is fine.”
  </Text>

  {" "}<Text strong>Islam says:</Text>

  <Text mark>
    &gt; “Every single life has sacred value. Even when you slaughter, do it with ihsan (excellence).”
  </Text>

  {" "}<Text underline>Western meat industries:</Text>

  {" "}<Text type="danger">Mass produce death,</Text>

  {" "}<Text italic>Disassociate consumers from the source of food,</Text>

  {" "}<Text type="danger">And leave behind animal corpses, waste, and suffering.</Text>

  {" "}<Text underline>Islamic Qurbani:</Text>

  {" "}<Text type="success">Involves clean, responsible animal care,</Text>

  {" "}<Text strong>Conscious remembrance of God before the act,</Text>

  {" "}<Text type="success">And meat distribution to the needy — uplifting the poor, not just feeding the rich.</Text>

  {" "}<Text strong>Which is more ethical?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  {" "}
  <Title level={4}>🔥 Final Slap of Truth</Title>

  <Title level={4}>🚩 Final Judgment: Veganism is a First-World Fantasy</Title> <br /><br />

  {" "}
  <Text strong>If vegans demand absolute consistency in ethics, then their philosophy collapses under its own unrealistic standards.</Text> <br />
  {" "}
  <Text underline>Here’s why:</Text> <br /><br />

  {" "}
  <Text strong>1. Crop Agriculture Kills More Animals Than Slaughter</Text> <br />
  {" "}
  <Text mark>Scientific Fact:</Text> Monoculture farming (soy, wheat, almonds) requires mass deforestation, pesticide use, and mechanized harvesting—killing billions of rodents, insects, and birds annually. <Text code>(Source: USDA)</Text> <br /><br />

  {" "}

  {" "}
  <Text strong>2. Humans Are Biologically Omnivores</Text> <br />

  {" "}
  <Text type="success">Conclusion:</Text> Veganism is a privileged, industrialized lifestyle, not a biological norm. <br /><br />

  {" "}
  <Text strong>3. "Ethical" Veganism Relies on Human Exploitation</Text> <br />
  {" "}
  <Text mark>Reality Check:</Text> Avocados, quinoa, and cashews are farmed using child labor, water hoarding, and slave wages in developing nations. <Text code>(Source: Oxfam)</Text> <br /><br />

  {" "}
  <Text type="warning">Hypocrisy:</Text> Vegans boycott meat for "ethics" but ignore human suffering in their own supply chains. <br /><br />

  <Text mark>Islam turns slaughter into a sacred responsibility. Hindu rituals often turn it into a festival of gore.</Text> <br /><br />

  {" "}
  <Text type="warning">So, who’s more humane?</Text> <br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>🔥 Final Verdict: No More Hypocrisy</Title> <br /><br />

  {" "}
  <Text type="danger">Here’s the brutal truth:</Text><br />
  <Text code> You don’t get to accuse others of cruelty when your own scriptures, avatars, and rituals include hunting, sacrifice, and bloodshed.</Text> <br /><br />

  <Text type="warning">Stop pretending Hinduism is a fluffy, vegan-friendly path of compassion.</Text><br /><br />

  • It has <Text strong>violence</Text>.<br />
  • It has <Text strong>killing</Text>.<br />
  • It has <Text strong>contradictions</Text>.<br /><br />

  Islam doesn’t force Hindus to eat beef.<br />
  <Text success>So Hindus need to stop dictating what Muslims eat based on their own idols, beliefs, and cow-worship.</Text> <br /><br />

  <Text underline>Religious pluralism</Text> means coexisting — not colonizing other people’s faith.<br /><br />

  And if your religion says cow is your mother, don’t bring that belief into law or mob violence. Because:<br /><br />

  <Text code> My God is not a cow. My religion is not yours. And your outrage is not justice — it’s bigotry.</Text><br /><br />

3. But What About Toxic Relatives?



</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Islam is balanced.</Text> It doesn't ask you to become a <Text type="danger">doormat</Text>.<br/>
  If a relative is <Text type="danger">abusive</Text>, <Text type="danger">manipulative</Text>, or <Text type="danger">toxic</Text>—you’re <Text mark>not required</Text> to let them walk all over you.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="success">Islam teaches boundaries.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  “Do not repay harm with harm, but you can distance with dignity.”
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>Block their evil</Text>, but <Text code>still pray for their guidance</Text>.<br/>
  <Text code>Cut off contact temporarily</Text> if it protects your mental health, but <Text italic>don’t carry hate in your heart</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And even then… <Text strong>respond to their salaam</Text>, and <Text mark>leave a door open for reconciliation</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Allah says in the Qur’an:</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  “Repel evil with that which is better; and thereupon, the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend.” (Surah Fussilat 41:34)
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text type="success">Islam doesn’t demand perfection</Text>—but it demands <Text strong>sincerity</Text> and <Text strong>class</Text>.

4. Cutting Off Relatives: A Deadly Sin




</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  “The one who cuts off the ties of kinship will not enter Paradise.” (Sahih Muslim)
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text mark>Read that again.</Text><br/>
  <Text code>Not. Enter. Paradise.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  That’s how <Text type="danger">serious</Text> this is.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Even if you <Text code>fast</Text>, <Text code>pray</Text>, <Text code>give zakah</Text>—if you’ve <Text type="danger">deliberately cut ties</Text> with relatives without valid reason, you’re <Text type="warning">risking your akhirah</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  And don’t forget—<Text strong>family isn’t just blood</Text>.<br/>
  Your <Text italic>stepmother</Text>. Your <Text italic>in-laws</Text>. Your <Text italic>adopted siblings</Text>. Islam gives <Text mark>everyone their due rights</Text>.
</Paragraph>








<Text underline><Title level={4}>5. When Relatives Are the Test—You Become the Rewarded



</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  Sometimes your family can feel like your <Text type="danger">biggest trial</Text>. But maybe… <Text italic>that’s exactly the point</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Because <Text strong>Jannah isn’t cheap</Text>.<br/>
  And Allah tests us through those <Text mark>closest to us</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  “Do people think they will be left alone because they say: ‘We believe,’ and will not be tested?” (Surah Al-Ankabut 29:2)
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  So when you <Text code>hold your tongue</Text> while your aunt mocks you…<br/>
  When you <Text code>forgive your brother</Text> for breaking your trust…<br/>
  When you <Text code>visit a cousin</Text> who never remembers your birthday…
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  You’re earning reward that <Text type="warning">angels can’t calculate</Text>.<br/>
  You’re walking a path that leads straight to <Text type="success">Allah’s pleasure</Text>.
</Paragraph>

Conclusion: Family Ties are a Path to Jannah—or a Rope to Hell



</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Let’s be clear:</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  You can’t <Text code>pray</Text> your way out of <Text type="danger">cutting off your relatives</Text>.<br/>
  You can’t <Text code>donate</Text> your way around <Text type="danger">disrespecting your kin</Text>.<br/>
  You can’t <Text code>fast</Text> your way through <Text type="danger">hatred in your heart</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text mark>Family is not a favor. It’s a fardh.</Text><br/>
  Allah gave you your relatives for a reason. Whether they’re a <Text type="success">comfort</Text> or a <Text type="warning">test</Text>—they’re part of your <Text italic>qadr</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Text code>Honor the good ones.</Text><br/>
  <Text code>Be patient with the difficult ones.</Text><br/>
  <Text code>Protect your soul</Text> by never becoming the one who <Text type="danger">cuts off ties</Text>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Because in Islam, <Text strong>blood is not just thicker than water</Text>—<Text mark>it’s sacred</Text>.
</Paragraph>
