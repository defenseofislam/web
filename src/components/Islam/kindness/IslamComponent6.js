🐑 Introduction: The Misunderstood Ritual


</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>

Every year during <Text strong>Eid al-Adha</Text>, <Text mark>Muslims across the world</Text> perform the ritual of animal sacrifice (<Text italic>Qurbani</Text>) to commemorate the legacy of <Text underline>Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) عليه السلام</Text> — who showed <Text strong>ultimate submission to God</Text> by being ready to sacrifice his own son <Text underline>Ishmael عليه السلام</Text>.

This sacrifice is:

<Text type="success"> {" "}Deeply symbolic, not just cultural.</Text>

<Text type="warning">{" "}Regulated by mercy and compassion, not bloodlust.</Text>

<Text strong>{" "}A charitable act that feeds millions of poor.</Text>

{" "}And yet, every year, <Text type="danger">not a single one is spared</Text> when the ritual is attacked, mocked, and demonized by:

<Text code>🐄 Vegan activists</Text>, claiming it's cruelty.

<Text code>🕉️ Hindu nationalists</Text>, accusing Muslims of barbarism.

<Text code>📰 Western liberals and media</Text>, painting it as savage.

Even <Text italic>some Christians</Text>, forgetting their own past of temple sacrifices.

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
These criticisms reek of ignorance, hypocrisy, and selective morality.
</Paragraph>

Let’s <Text strong>destroy these double standards</Text> once and for all. And yeah next time, if someone <Text type="danger">dares</Text> criticizing Eid, <Text strong>SHOW THIS ARTICLE AS A TOOL FOR EXORCISM OF THE CRITICS!</Text>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>🌱 1. Refuting Vegan and Animal Rights Criticism: Hypocrisy Exposed</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>Let’s get real:</Title>

  <Text mark>
    &gt; If you eat burgers, wear leather, or enjoy eggs and milk — don’t lecture Muslims about “animal cruelty.”
  </Text>

  <Text strong>{" "}Muslims are not suddenly harming animals on Eid.</Text> Islam requires: {" "}

  <Text underline>Animals to be fed, rested, and not mistreated.</Text>{" "}

  <Text underline>Slaughter to be quick and painless, avoiding torture.</Text>{" "}

  <Text underline>Parts of meat to be distributed to the poor, not wasted.</Text>{" "}

  <Text strong>This isn’t a blood ritual or savagery.</Text> It’s a <Text italic>divine command</Text> rooted in <Text mark>compassion, gratitude, and charity</Text> — a ritual that:

  <Text type="success">{" "}Reminds us of our dependence on Allah,</Text>

  <Text type="warning">{" "}Breaks the ego of the privileged,</Text>

  <Text type="success">{" "}And feeds the hungry, not fills freezers for fun.</Text>

  <Title level={4}>Meanwhile:</Title>

  <Text type="danger">In the West, industrial meat farming involves electrocuting, confining, and force-feeding animals, stacking them in crates, clipping beaks, snapping bones during transportation, and gassing them in slaughterhouses.</Text>

  {" "}<Text mark>Over 150 million animals are killed every single day globally — not for God, not for reflection, not for charity, but just for fast food, greasy profits, and gluttony.</Text>

  <Text type="warning">{" "}And let’s not ignore the brutal irony:</Text> <Text type="danger">Many vegans loudly support abortion-on-demand, where the unborn feel pain — but they scream about Muslims sacrificing lambs for Eid charity.</Text> <Text strong>That's hypocrisy dipped in soy milk.</Text>

  <Title level={4}>Qurbani is mercy, not cruelty.</Title>
  <Text strong>It connects the eater to the Creator, and to the animal itself.</Text> It’s not mindless consumption — it’s a ritual of <Text underline>reflection, submission, and responsibility.</Text>

  <Title level={4}>🐐 Islam’s Mercy Toward Animals: Not Just Eid — Always</Title>

  <Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
    Islam is light-years ahead of modern “animal rights” slogans when it comes to real compassion. Unlike secular ethics, which shift with opinion polls, Islamic law has timeless rulings grounded in the sacredness of life — even animal life.
  </Paragraph>

  <Title level={4}>Here are examples that demolish the myth that Islam promotes cruelty:</Title>

  <Text strong>🔹 The Prophet ﷺ said:</Text>

  <Text mark>
    &gt; “Verily, Allah has prescribed excellence in everything. If you kill, kill well. If you slaughter, slaughter well. Let one of you sharpen his blade and spare suffering to the animal.”  
    <Text strong>( Proof - Sahih Muslim 1955)</Text>
  </Text>
    <br /> <br />
  <Text strong>This isn't optional. It’s a command.</Text> And it’s centuries ahead of modern animal welfare guidelines.
<br /> <br />
  <Text strong>🔹 Another Hadith:</Text>

  <Text mark>
    &gt; “Do not sharpen your knife in front of the animal. Do you want to kill it twice?”  
    (al-Bayhaqi, Shu’ab al-Iman)
  </Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text italic>Imagine that.</Text> Over 1400 years ago, Islam forbade psychological stress to animals — even for seconds before slaughter. While in today’s meat factories, animals see and hear others dying, screaming in fear before being stunned or sliced by conveyor belts.
<br /> <br />
  <Text strong>🔹 A woman was condemned to Hell because she locked up a cat until it died:</Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text mark>
    &gt; “The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "A woman entered the (Hell) Fire because of a cat which she had tied, neither giving it food nor setting it free to eat from the vermin of the earth. ".”  
    <Text strong>( Proof - Sahih Bukhari 3318)</Text>
  </Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text mark>
    &gt; "Nafi’ reported from ‘Abdullah that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: A woman was punished because she had kept a cat tied until it died, and (as a punishment of this offence) she was thrown into the Hell. She had not provided it with food, or drink, and had not freed her so that she could eat the insects of the earth."  
    <Text strong>( Proof - Sahih Muslim Book 26, Hadith Number 5570 )</Text>
  </Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text type="danger">This shows that cruelty to even one animal, if done intentionally and without mercy, is enough to risk damnation.</Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text strong>🔹 Conversely, a Prostitute was forgiven by Allah for giving water to a thirsty dog:</Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text mark>
    &gt; “Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "A prostitute was forgiven by Allah, because, passing by a panting dog near a well and seeing that the dog was about to die of thirst, she took off her shoe, and tying it with her head-cover she drew out some water for it. So, Allah forgave her because of that."”  
    <Text strong>( Proof - Sahih Bukhari 3321)</Text>
  </Text>
<br /> <br />
  <Text type="success">Let that sink in:</Text> <Text italic>an act of mercy to a dog — an animal that many societies considered impure — earned a sinner forgiveness from the Most High.</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>🛑 Vegan Hypocrisy and the Religion of Emotional Extremism</Title>

  <Text italic>Some vegans and animal rights activists claim the moral high ground.</Text> But let's ask:

  {" "}<Text mark>Do they protest fast food chains with the same energy they attack Muslims?</Text>

  {" "}<Text underline>Do they stop buying iPhones, knowing animal testing and human labor exploitation are involved?</Text>

  {" "}<Text mark>Why don’t they march against the scientific labs that torture animals daily, or designer industries that skin animals alive for fashion?</Text>

  {" "}<Text strong>No. Because this isn’t about animals.</Text>  
  {" "}It’s about <Text type="warning">virtue signaling, cultural supremacy, and Islamophobia dressed as ethics.</Text>

  {" "}<Text type="danger">They don’t care about the sheep.</Text> They care about <Text underline>demonizing the people who say “Bismillah” before slaughter.</Text>

  <Title level={4}>⚖ Islam vs Secular Ethics: Who Really Cares?</Title>

  <Text italic>Modern secular ethics say:</Text>

  <Text mark>
    &gt; “As long as it’s efficient, mass-scale animal death is fine.”
  </Text>

  {" "}<Text strong>Islam says:</Text>

  <Text mark>
    &gt; “Every single life has sacred value. Even when you slaughter, do it with ihsan (excellence).”
  </Text>

  {" "}<Text underline>Western meat industries:</Text>

  {" "}<Text type="danger">Mass produce death,</Text>

  {" "}<Text italic>Disassociate consumers from the source of food,</Text>

  {" "}<Text type="danger">And leave behind animal corpses, waste, and suffering.</Text>

  {" "}<Text underline>Islamic Qurbani:</Text>

  {" "}<Text type="success">Involves clean, responsible animal care,</Text>

  {" "}<Text strong>Conscious remembrance of God before the act,</Text>

  {" "}<Text type="success">And meat distribution to the needy — uplifting the poor, not just feeding the rich.</Text>

  {" "}<Text strong>Which is more ethical?</Text>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  {" "}
  <Title level={4}>🔥 Final Slap of Truth</Title>

  <Title level={4}>🚩 Final Judgment: Veganism is a First-World Fantasy</Title> <br /><br />

  {" "}
  <Text strong>If vegans demand absolute consistency in ethics, then their philosophy collapses under its own unrealistic standards.</Text> <br />
  {" "}
  <Text underline>Here’s why:</Text> <br /><br />

  {" "}
  <Text strong>1. Crop Agriculture Kills More Animals Than Slaughter</Text> <br />
  {" "}
  <Text mark>Scientific Fact:</Text> Monoculture farming (soy, wheat, almonds) requires mass deforestation, pesticide use, and mechanized harvesting—killing billions of rodents, insects, and birds annually. <Text code>(Source: USDA)</Text> <br /><br />

  {" "}

  {" "}
  <Text strong>2. Humans Are Biologically Omnivores</Text> <br />

  {" "}
  <Text type="success">Conclusion:</Text> Veganism is a privileged, industrialized lifestyle, not a biological norm. <br /><br />

  {" "}
  <Text strong>3. "Ethical" Veganism Relies on Human Exploitation</Text> <br />
  {" "}
  <Text mark>Reality Check:</Text> Avocados, quinoa, and cashews are farmed using child labor, water hoarding, and slave wages in developing nations. <Text code>(Source: Oxfam)</Text> <br /><br />

  {" "}
  <Text type="warning">Hypocrisy:</Text> Vegans boycott meat for "ethics" but ignore human suffering in their own supply chains. <br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>🧠 Rebuttals & Counter-Rebuttals: Hindu Criticism of Islamic Slaughter</Title><br /><br />

  <Text strong>1. Rebuttal: "Hinduism Has Evolved Beyond Animal Sacrifice"</Text><br />
  <Text italic>Argument:</Text><br />
  Modern Hinduism largely rejects animal sacrifice, especially in mainstream Vaishnavism/Shaivism. Scriptural practices ≠ current beliefs.<br /><br />

  <Text underline>Counter:</Text><br />
  <Text mark>Selective Evolution:</Text> If Hinduism can "update" its practices, why can’t Muslims follow their unchanged divine commands?<br />
  <Text strong>Active Rituals:</Text> Gadhimai, Durga Puja, and tribal traditions still involve sacrifices. The claim that "all Hindus are pacifist" is false.<br />
  <Text type="danger">Hypocrisy:</Text> If animal sacrifice is "outdated," why attack Muslims for following their texts while ignoring Hindu texts that explicitly permit it?<br /><br />

  <Text strong>2. Rebuttal: "Beef Export ≠ Hindu Approval"</Text><br />
  <Text italic>Argument:</Text><br />
  Beef exports are done by non-Hindus (Muslims/Christians) or corrupt businesses—not representative of Hindu values.<br /><br />

  <Text underline>Counter:</Text><br />
  <Text mark>Economic Complicity:</Text> If Hindus truly opposed beef, they’d ban all slaughter (like Nepal did after Gadhimai backlash). Instead, India profits from it.<br />
  <Text strong>Legal Double Standard:</Text> BJP-ruled states ban cow slaughter but allow buffalo exports (which are also considered "gau vansh").<br />
  <Text type="danger">Silence = Consent:</Text> No mass Hindu protests against beef exports—only against Muslim Qurbani.<br /><br />

  <Text strong>3. Rebuttal: "Ram/Krishna Ate Meat, But We Don’t Anymore"</Text><br />
  <Text italic>Argument:</Text><br />
  Avatars lived in a different era; modern Hindus reject meat due to ahimsa (non-violence).<br /><br />

  <Text underline>Counter:</Text><br />
  <Text mark>Scriptural Authority:</Text> If Ram/Krishna’s actions are irrelevant, why cite them for other issues (e.g., Ram Mandir)?<br />
  <Text strong>Ahimsa Hypocrisy:</Text> Why is killing for religion (e.g., Jallikattu, Gadhimai) acceptable but halal isn’t?<br />
  <Text type="warning">Selective Pacifism:</Text> Many Hindus still eat meat (especially in Bengal, Kerala, Northeast).<br /><br />

  <Text strong>4. Rebuttal: "Halal is Crueler Than Jhatka"</Text><br />
  <Text italic>Argument:</Text><br />
  Jhatka (instant decapitation) is more humane than halal (throat-cutting).<br /><br />

  <Text underline>Counter:</Text><br />
  <Text mark>Science Says Otherwise:</Text> Studies show throat-cutting with a sharp blade (halal) causes less pain than blunt-force trauma (Jhatka). (Source: FAO)<br />
  <Text strong>Islamic Rules &gt; Hindu Rituals:</Text> Halal requires no stress before death, while Gadhimai/Durga Puja involve public terror and blunt weapons.<br />
  <Text type="danger">Hypocrisy:</Text> If Hindus cared about "painless death," they’d reform their own bloody festivals first.<br /><br />

  <Text strong>5. Rebuttal: "Cow is Sacred, So Ban Its Slaughter"</Text><br />
  <Text italic>Argument:</Text><br />
  Since cows are holy to Hindus, Muslims should respect that in India.<br /><br />

  <Text underline>Counter:</Text><br />
  <Text mark>Religious Freedom:</Text> Muslims don’t demand bans on pig slaughter in Muslim countries for Hindus.<br />
  <Text strong>Logical Fallacy:</Text> If "sacredness" justifies bans, should Muslims ban alcohol because it’s haram?<br />
  <Text type="warning">Slippery Slope:</Text> Tomorrow, some sect may declare potatoes sacred—will we ban them too?<br /><br />

  <Text strong>6. Rebuttal: "Hindu Outrage is Against Illegal Slaughter"</Text><br />
  <Text italic>Argument:</Text><br />
  Protests are only against cow smuggling and illegal abattoirs, not halal.<br /><br />

  <Text underline>Counter:</Text><br />
  <Text mark>Lynching Innocents:</Text> Mob attacks target legal transporters and even dairy farmers. (Source: Human Rights Watch)<br />
  <Text strong>Silence on Buffaloes:</Text> If cows are sacred, why no outrage over buffalo slaughter (same species)?<br />
  <Text type="danger">Selective Enforcement:</Text> BJP states shut down legal Muslim-run abattoirs while ignoring Hindu-run ones.<br /><br />

  <Text strong>7. Rebuttal: "Hinduism Promotes Vegetarianism"</Text><br />
  <Text italic>Argument:</Text><br />
  True Hindus are vegetarian; meat-eating is a "Muslim/invader" influence.<br /><br />

  <Text underline>Counter:</Text><br />
  <Text mark>Historical Fact:</Text> Aryans ate beef (Rigveda 10.85.13). Brahmins in Kashmir, Bengal, and Kerala still eat meat.<br />
  <Text strong>Caste Hypocrisy:</Text> Upper-caste Hindus impose vegetarianism on Dalits/OBCs who traditionally ate meat.<br />
  <Text type="danger">Modern Reality:</Text> India is the world’s 2nd-largest meat consumer (after China).<br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>💥 Final Knockout: The Hindu Extremist Contradiction</Title><br />
  If Hindutva activists truly believed in:<br />
  ✔️ Ahimsa — They’d ban all animal slaughter (not just cows).<br />
  ✔️ Scriptural Purity — They’d revive horse sacrifices (Ashvamedha).<br />
  ✔️ Consistency — They’d protest buffalo exports as fiercely as cow slaughter.<br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>🕊️ Conclusion: Pluralism or Bigotry?</Title><br />
  Islam allows Hindus to worship cows. (PROOF -  SURAH AL KAFIROON VERSE 6, SURAH 60 V.8 )<br />
  Hinduism must allow Muslims to practice halal.<br /><br />

✝ 3. Refuting Christian Hypocrisy: The Bible’s Bloody Legacy of Animal Sacrifice



</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>Christian critics love to portray Islam as "violent" for Qurbani, while their own scripture drowns in animal blood.</Title> Let’s expose the Bible’s brutal sacrifice culture they conveniently ignore.<br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>🔪 Animal Slaughter in the Bible: A Gruesome Catalog</Title><br /><br />

  <Text strong>1. The Holocaust of Burnt Offerings</Text><br />
  <Text italic>God demands entire animals be burned alive for His pleasure:</Text><br /><br />

  <Text code>"You shall burn the whole ram on the altar. It is a burnt offering to the Lord, a pleasing aroma." (Exodus 29:18)</Text><br /><br />

  Cows, sheep, goats, pigeons—all roasted alive in God’s name.<br />
  <Text type="danger">No mercy, no food distribution—just wasted meat turned to ash.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text strong>2. Blood Sprinkling: God’s Favorite Ritual</Text><br />
  <Text code>"Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins." (Hebrews 9:22)</Text><br /><br />

  Priests had to splash blood on altars, clothes, and people (Leviticus 4:6).<br />
  <Text mark>Temple floors were literal slaughterhouses—drenched in animal blood daily.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text strong>3. Mass Animal Genocide for Sin Relief</Text><br />
  On Yom Kippur, Jews had to:<br />
  <Text code>"Kill a bull as a sin offering, a ram as a burnt offering... and two goats—one sacrificed, one driven into the wilderness." (Leviticus 16)</Text><br /><br />

  Thousands of animals died yearly just to "cleanse" people’s sins.<br />
  <Text type="warning">No ethical concern—just mechanical slaughter for divine appeasement.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text strong>4. Jesus: The Ultimate Blood Sacrifice</Text><br />
  Christianity’s entire theology is built on:<br />
  <Text code>"Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed." (1 Corinthians 5:7)</Text><br /><br />

  <Text underline>God "needs" human blood (Jesus) to forgive sins—more barbaric than any Eid sacrifice.</Text><br /><br />
  Yet Christians mock Muslims for a single lamb slaughtered humanely for charity?<br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>🔥 Christianity’s Bloody Contradictions</Title><br /><br />

  If animal sacrifice is "outdated," why did God demand it for centuries?<br />
  <Text italic>Did God change His mind? Or did Christians just rewrite morality?</Text><br /><br />

  If Jesus "ended" sacrifices, why is his death framed as one?<br />
  <Text type="danger">Either sacrifice is divine (so Eid is valid) or it’s not (so Jesus’ death is meaningless).</Text><br /><br />

  Why do Christians eat meat daily but attack Eid sacrifices?<br />
  <Text mark>Factory farms torture animals 24/7—yet they rage at one merciful slaughter?</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>☠ Final Blow: The Christian Meat-Eating Hypocrisy</Title><br /><br />

  Before any Christian dares to criticize Eid:<br /><br />

  • Stop eating KFC, burgers, and bacon—all from factory-farmed torture.<br />
  • <Text strong>Denounce the Old Testament—or admit God once loved sacrifices.</Text><br />
  • <Text underline>Explain why Jesus’ blood-magic is "moral" but feeding the poor isn’t.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text type="success">Otherwise, shut your pulpits and check your scripture.</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>🚨 BOTTOM LINE:</Title><br /><br />

  <Text mark>Christians sacrificed animals for 1500 years, then switched to human sacrifice (Jesus), and now pretend to be morally superior?</Text><br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">Your Bible is bloodier than any halal slaughter.</Text><br />
  <Text type="warning">Your theology is built on slaughter.</Text><br />

  <Text italic>Christian Argument:</Text><br />
  <Text code>"The New Testament abolished Old Testament sacrifices! We don’t do that anymore!"</Text><br /><br />

  <Text underline>Counter:</Text><br /><br />
  Then why is Jesus called the <Text mark>"Lamb of God"</Text> (John 1:29)? You replaced animal sacrifice with human sacrifice—how is that less barbaric?<br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">If God changed His mind, does that mean He was wrong before? Or are you cherry-picking scripture?</Text><br /><br />

  <Text type="warning">Paul still ate meat from sacrifices (1 Corinthians 10:25)—so why do you attack Muslims for doing the same?</Text><br /><br />

  <Text strong>2. Rebuttal: "Our Meat Comes from Humane Farms!"</Text><br />
  <Text italic>Christian Argument:</Text><br />
  <Text code>"We don’t support cruel slaughter—we buy ethical meat!"</Text><br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">99% of your meat comes from factory farms—electrocution, debeaking, live grinding of chicks. (Source: ASPCA)</Text><br /><br />

  Where’s your outrage at industrial farming? Or is it only <Text mark>"cruel"</Text> when Muslims do it?<br /><br />

  <Text underline>If you really cared, you’d be vegan. But you’re not—so stop pretending.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text strong>3. Rebuttal: "Eid Sacrifices are Public & Traumatic!"</Text><br />
  <Text italic>Christian Argument:</Text><br />
  <Text code>"Muslims slaughter animals in streets—it’s disturbing!"</Text><br /><br />

  Ever been to a Texas slaughterhouse? The screams are worse than any Eid.<br /><br />
  Christian medieval Europe had public executions, witch burnings, and bullfights—now you’re sensitive?<br /><br />

  <Text type="success">Islamic rules forbid animal stress. Your industrial farms torture animals daily—where’s your protest?</Text><br /><br />

  <Text strong>4. Rebuttal: "We Don’t Worship a Bloodthirsty God!"</Text><br />
  <Text italic>Christian Argument:</Text><br />
  <Text code>"Our God is love—He doesn’t demand blood!"</Text><br /><br />

  Then why did He demand burnt offerings (Leviticus 1:9), Passover lambs (Exodus 12), and human sacrifice (Jesus)?<br /><br />

  <Text underline>Your entire salvation depends on bloodshed—either admit it or stop calling Islam violent.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text mark>God in the Bible loves blood:</Text><br />
  <Text code>"The life is in the blood… I have given it for you on the altar." (Leviticus 17:11)</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>🔥 Final Scolding: Christians, Shut Up & Watch Eid Like Good Boys</Title><br /><br />

  ✔️ <Text type="danger">Your Bible is a slaughter manual.</Text><br />
  ✔️ <Text type="warning">Your salvation depends on a human sacrifice.</Text><br />
  ✔️ <Text type="success">Your KFC addiction supports factory torture.</Text><br /><br />

💵 4. PETA and Western Double Standards: White Tears, Black Lies

</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>PETA and Other "Animal Rights" Groups: Hypocrisy Exposed</Title><br /><br />

  PETA and other so-called <Text mark>"animal rights"</Text> groups love to weaponize images of Eid sacrifices to stir outrage. But their hypocrisy is staggering. Let’s expose their <Text type="danger">racist, Islamophobic, and selective activism.</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>🚨 PETA’s Selective Outrage: Islamophobia in Disguise</Title><br /><br />

  <Text mark>1. They Ignore Industrial Torture</Text><br />
  McDonald’s, KFC, Tyson Foods slaughter billions of animals yearly—electrocuted, debeaked, crushed alive—but PETA stays dead silent.<br /><br />
  Where are their protests? Nowhere. Because attacking Muslims gets more clicks than challenging corporate meat giants.<br /><br />

  <Text mark>2. They Fear Jewish Backlash (Kosher Slaughter)</Text><br />
  Kosher slaughter (Shechita) is nearly identical to Halal—yet PETA rarely criticizes it. Why?<br /><br />
  Because they know Jewish groups will sue them into oblivion for antisemitism. Muslims? Easy targets.<br /><br />

  <Text mark>3. They Romanticize Western Cruelty</Text><br />
  Hunting? A <Text code>"sport"</Text> where animals are shot, left to bleed out, and mounted as trophies—but PETA shrugs.<br /><br />
  Fur trade? Animals skinned alive—yet PETA spends more time harassing Muslim butchers than Chanel.<br /><br />
  Animal testing? Labs torture monkeys, rabbits, and dogs—but PETA’s too busy demonizing Eid.<br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>Halal vs. Western Slaughter: The Stark Contrast in Humanity</Title><br /><br />
  When it comes to animal slaughter, the difference between Islamic halal methods and Western industrial practices couldn’t be more extreme.<br /><br />

  <Text strong>Halal slaughter requires:</Text><br />
  <Text type="success">✔ A razor-sharp blade for an instant, painless cut</Text><br />
  <Text type="success">✔ The animal to be well-fed, calm, and unaware of its fate</Text><br />
  <Text type="success">✔ No animal may witness another being slaughtered</Text><br />
  <Text type="success">✔ The name of God (Bismillah) to be invoked, honoring the life taken</Text><br />
  <Text type="success">✔ Every part of the animal to be used—nothing wasted</Text><br /><br />

  <Text strong>Meanwhile, Western factory farming involves:</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">❌ Electrocution, gas chambers, and blunt-force trauma as standard killing methods</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">❌ Animals crammed into trucks for days without food/water, screaming in terror</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">❌ Mechanical disassembly lines where many animals are still conscious when butchered</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">❌ Mass waste—with millions of tons of meat discarded yearly while people starve</Text><br /><br />

  <Text underline>The hypocrisy is glaring:</Text> PETA attacks a sacred, regulated practice that minimizes suffering, while turning a blind eye to corporate slaughterhouses where animals endure hell daily.<br /><br />

  If animal welfare was truly the concern, activists would be:<br />
  ✔️ Storming Tyson Foods headquarters<br />
  ✔️ Shutting down KFC suppliers<br />
  ✔️ Exposing the pork industry’s live-grinding of piglets<br /><br />

  But no—they’d rather target Muslim grandmothers buying goats for Eid than challenge the real mass murderers: <Text type="warning">Wall Street meat monopolies.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text strong>Conclusion:</Text> This was never about animals. It’s about demonizing Muslim traditions while excusing Western cruelty. <Text type="danger">The numbers don’t lie—industrial farming is the true Holocaust of innocents.</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>🤡 PETA’s Racist Hypocrisy: A Case Study</Title><br /><br />
  When a Muslim sacrifices a goat: PETA screams <Text type="warning">"barbaric!"</Text> and floods social media with gore.<br /><br />
  When a Texas rancher shoots deer for fun: PETA posts nothing.<br /><br />
  When a Hindu sacrifices a buffalo at Gadhimai: PETA looks the other way.<br /><br />
  When a Jewish slaughterhouse kills thousands of chickens: PETA whispers.<br /><br />

  Why? Because <Text code>brown people’s traditions are "savage," but white people’s cruelty is "culture."</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>💀 The Ugly Truth: PETA Kills Animals Too</Title><br /><br />
  PETA’s own shelters euthanize over 80% of pets they "rescue." (Source: VDACS Reports)<br /><br />
  They’ve stolen and killed people’s pets—then called it "mercy."<br /><br />
  Yet they lecture Muslims about <Text underline>"compassion"</Text>? The audacity.<br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>🔥 Final Verdict: PETA, Sit Down & Shut Up</Title><br /><br />
  Before PETA dares to criticize Eid again, they must:<br />
  <Text strong>• Boycott KFC, McDonald’s, and Walmart—the real animal killers.</Text><br />
  <Text strong>• Protest Wall Street meat monopolies—not street vendors.</Text><br />
  <Text strong>• Apologize for euthanizing thousands of pets while pretending to care.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text mark>"Halal slaughter happens openly in streets, while factory farms are hidden. We target what people see!"</Text><br /><br />

  <Text underline>Counter:</Text><br /><br />
  False. PETA intentionally films inside slaughterhouses when it suits them (e.g., releasing undercover footage of farms).<br /><br />
  Why not expose Tyson or KFC with the same energy? Because Muslim sacrifices are easier to villainize.<br /><br />

  <Text underline>Counter:</Text><br /><br />
  <Text type="danger">Liar.</Text> Kosher (Shechita) and Halal are nearly identical—both require throat-cutting without stunning.<br /><br />

  <Text code>Islamophobia sells better to their donor base.</Text><br /><br />

</Title></Text>
<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>Let’s face it:</Title><br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">Billions of animals are killed every year globally.</Text><br /><br />
  Most die painfully, unnoticed, and <Text italic>without purpose</Text>.<br /><br />
  No remembrance of God, no charity, no meaning.<br /><br />

  <Text type="warning">Just profit.</Text><br />
  <Text type="warning">Just appetite.</Text><br />
  <Text type="warning">Just waste.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text code>Factories strip animals of dignity.</Text><br />
  <Text code>Supermarkets turn flesh into faceless products.</Text><br />
  And consumers <Text underline>never ask why</Text> — or for whom.<br /><br />

  <Text strong>But Eid al-Adha is the opposite:</Text><br /><br />

  <Text mark>Purposeful,</Text><br />
  <Text mark>Reverent,</Text><br />
  <Text mark>Generous.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text underline>A life is taken</Text> — but <Text italic>in the name of God</Text>.<br /><br />
  A portion is given — <Text type="success">to the hungry.</Text><br /><br />
  A lesson is learned — about submission, sacrifice, and humility.<br /><br />

  For Muslims, it’s <Text strong>not about indulgence</Text>.<br />
  It’s about Ibrahim’s willingness to give up what he loved — <Text italic>for the sake of the One who gave it to him</Text>.<br /><br />

  <Text underline>That is what the sacrifice symbolizes.</Text><br /><br />

  So if the world can eat meat for taste,<br />
  <Text strong>Muslims can sacrifice for God and the poor.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text code>One kills for consumption.</Text><br />
  <Text code>The other gives to remember the Creator, and to uplift the creation.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text type="danger">One forgets the soul.</Text><br />

  <Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
    And in a world that kills without thinking, Muslims choose to pause, reflect, and give back — through the very act of taking.

🕋 5. The Purpose of Qurbani: Submission and Social Welfare
</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>Eid al-Adha is not about slaughter for pleasure.</Title> It is a divine ritual that embodies:<br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>Commemorating Ibrahim’s Ultimate Submission</Title><br /><br />

  When Allah commanded Prophet Ibrahim (AS) to sacrifice his beloved son, he obeyed without hesitation.<br /><br />

  At the last moment, Allah replaced Ismail (AS) with a ram—<Text type="success">showing that true submission is tested, but divine mercy prevails.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text strong>Qurbani reenacts this test of faith</Text>, reminding Muslims that devotion to Allah comes before all worldly attachments.<br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>Feeding the Poor & Strengthening Community</Title><br /><br />

  <Text strong>One-third of the meat must be given to the needy</Text>—ensuring no one is left hungry on Eid.<br /><br />

  Unlike Western waste (<Text type="danger">where 60% of edible food is trashed</Text>), Qurbani ensures <Text type="success">zero waste</Text>:<br /><br />

  <Text code>Meat is distributed fresh.</Text><br />
  <Text code>Bones and skin are used for broth, gelatin, or charity projects.</Text><br />
  <Text code>Even the hooves and horns are repurposed in some cultures.</Text><br /><br />

  In refugee camps, war zones, and impoverished regions, <Text mark>Qurbani meat is often the only protein people eat all year.</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>A Lesson in Responsibility & Gratitude</Title><br /><br />

  Muslims are commanded to:<br />
  <Text code>Choose healthy, well-fed animals (no sick or malnourished ones).</Text><br />
  <Text code>Treat them kindly before slaughter (no stress, no fear).</Text><br />
  <Text code>Slaughter swiftly (minimizing pain).</Text><br /><br />

  This process forces us to confront where our food comes from—<Text italic>unlike factory-farmed meat, where consumers remain detached from the killing.</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>Breaking the Chains of Greed</Title><br /><br />

  In a world obsessed with hoarding wealth, Qurbani demands:<br /><br />

  <Text strong>Sacrificing a valuable asset</Text> (a healthy goat, sheep, or cow costs hundreds).<br /><br />
  <Text strong>Giving it away freely</Text>—not just to family, but to strangers.<br /><br />

  It’s a direct challenge to <Text type="danger">capitalism’s "me-first" mentality.</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>🌍 Global Impact: Where Qurbani Meat Goes</Title><br /><br />

  <Text underline>Africa:</Text> In Somalia and Sudan, Qurbani feeds famine-stricken families.<br />
  <Text underline>South Asia:</Text> In Bangladesh and Pakistan, orphanages rely on Eid meat for nutrition.<br />
  <Text underline>War Zones:</Text> Syrian refugees in camps receive fresh meat only during Eid.<br />
  <Text underline>Inner Cities:</Text> Western Muslim charities distribute Qurbani meat to homeless shelters.<br /><br />

  <Text mark>This is Islam’s vision of food justice</Text>—not just "no cruelty," but <Text type="success">active compassion</Text>.<br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>💡 Why Anti-Qurbani Critics Fail</Title><br /><br />

  <Text type="warning">They ignore the charity.</Text> (Where’s their outrage at food waste?)<br />
  <Text type="warning">They pretend Islam invented slaughter.</Text> (The Bible, Vedas, and ancient cultures all sacrificed animals.)<br />
  <Text type="warning">They demand Muslims abandon faith to please them.</Text> (Never happening.)<br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>🕌 Final Reminder: Qurbani is Sacred, Not Savage</Title><br /><br />

  Allah says:<br />
  <Text code>"It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is piety from you that reaches Him." (Quran 22:37)</Text><br /><br />

  <Text italic>This means:</Text><br /><br />

  <Text strong>The physical slaughter is not the goal</Text>—it’s the spiritual surrender.<br />
  <Text strong>The meat is not the focus</Text>—it’s the act of giving.<br /><br />

  So to the critics:<br />
  <Text type="danger">Your fake tears won’t stop Qurbani.</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">Your hypocrisy won’t erase its blessings.</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">And your ignorance won’t change divine law.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text type="success">Eid Mubarak. The sacrifice continues. 🐑⚔️</Text>

<Text underline><Title level={4}>🕌 Conclusion: Don’t You Dare Shame Us for Worshiping God</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>The world kills animals for:</Title><br /><br />

  <Text code>Profit,</Text><br />
  <Text code>Taste,</Text><br />
  <Text code>Fashion,</Text><br />
  <Text code>Experimentation.</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>We kill animals:</Title><br /><br />

  <Text code>With the name of God,</Text><br />
  <Text code>With mercy,</Text><br />
  <Text code>With charity.</Text><br /><br />

  So <Text type="warning">don’t come at Muslims</Text> with your <Text underline>media hysteria</Text>, <Text type="danger">moral double standards</Text>, and <Text italic>anti-Islamic bile.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text strong>We don’t need approval</Text> from PETA, Hindutva mobs, vegan influencers, or Christian missionaries.<br /><br />

  <Text mark>We need the approval of Allah</Text> — and that’s what we seek on Eid al-Adha.<br /><br />

  <Text type="secondary" italic>---</Text><br /><br />

  <Title level={4}>To all the trolls:</Title><br /><br />

  <Text code>&gt; Until you stop killing animals for fries,</Text><br />
  <Text code>&gt; Don’t dare shame us for sacrificing for the sake of God.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text type="success">Qurbani is worship.</Text><br />
  <Text type="danger">Your criticism? Just noise.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text italic>If you behave properly with us, we might just bless you with a juicy lamb leg — and a lesson in humility.</Text><br /><br />

  <Text underline>So hush now, keyboard muftis and bacon-brained philosophers.</Text> The adults are worshipping.<br /><br />

  <Text type="success">Happy Eid Al-Adha 2025 & forever till Day of Judgement</Text>, you naughty critics 😘!<br /><br />

  <Text type="warning">K.O.</Text> <Text type="danger">Fatality.</Text> <Text strong>#QurbaniWins</Text> 🐐⚔️
