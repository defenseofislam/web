<Paragraph>
  <Text italic>
    This article critically addresses and refutes the recurring allegation

    <Text type="warning">Near Eastern</Text> religious traditions.

  Rather than simply reproducing pre-existing narratives,
  <Text mark>
    the Quran reconfigures them with distinct theological, moral, and

  </Text>{" "}
  Through <Text underline>detailed textual analysis</Text>,{" "}

<Paragraph>
  The article further explores the Quran’s engagement with previous scriptures

          1. Introduction: Understanding the Nature of the Allegations
        </Title>
        <Paragraph>
  The allegations that <Text strong>Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)</Text>{" "}
  <Text type="danger">plagiarized</Text> or borrowed content from earlier
  religious and cultural traditions have long been a point of contention in{" "}
  <Text underline>scholarly</Text> and <Text underline>public discourse</Text>. These
  critiques often stem from the assumption that the{" "}
  <Text strong>Quran</Text>, as a religious and literary work, must be{" "}
  <Text delete>derivative</Text> in nature and a mere amalgamation of
  pre-existing ideas. Such claims include the accusation that the Quran contains elements
  borrowed from:
  <br />
  <Text mark>- Judeo-Christian scriptures</Text> (including the{" "}
  <Text type="warning">Torah</Text>, <Text type="warning">Psalms</Text>, and{" "}
  <Text type="warning">Gospel</Text>), with some critics arguing that the Quran’s
  stories of the prophets and narratives of religious history are lifted
  directly from earlier texts.
  <br />
  <Text mark>- Pre-Islamic Arabian poetry</Text> as well as the{" "}
  <Text type="warning">oral traditions</Text> of the Arabian Peninsula. This includes
  claims that the Quran’s <Text italic>style</Text>,{" "}
  <Text italic>rhythm</Text>, and certain phrases are influenced by the poetic
  conventions of the time, implying that its literary form is merely an
  adaptation of ancient Arabic poetic forms.
  <br />
  <Text mark>
    - Zoroastrian and other regional religious traditions
  </Text>{" "}
  with assertions that themes found in the Quran, such as the{" "}
  <Text type="success">duality of good and evil</Text> or the concepts of the{" "}
  <Text strong>afterlife</Text>, are taken from Persian and Mesopotamian
  religious thought. Critics point to supposed parallels in these ancient
  religious systems as evidence of the Quran's dependence on earlier{" "}
  <Text type="warning">mythologies</Text> and religious teachings.
  <br />
  These critiques, while numerous, fundamentally{" "}
  <Text type="danger">misunderstand</Text> the nature of the Quran’s{" "}
  <Text strong>self-proclaimed divine mission</Text>. The Quran explicitly presents
  itself not as a mere continuation or repetition of past religious ideas but
  as a <Text mark>corrective continuation of divine revelation</Text> — a
  revelation that seeks to <Text strong>refine</Text>,{" "}
  <Text strong>clarify</Text>, and <Text strong>correct</Text> the{" "}
  <Text type="warning">theological</Text>, <Text type="warning">moral</Text>, and{" "}
  <Text type="warning">historical narratives</Text> presented in earlier
  scriptures. The Quran claims to be the <Text code>final, unaltered word of God</Text>,
  revealing truths that were either <Text type="danger">distorted</Text> or{" "}
  <Text type="danger">lost</Text> over time, making it{" "}
  <Text underline>unique</Text> in both <Text italic>content</Text> and{" "}
  <Text italic>form</Text>.
  <br />
  Rather than engaging in simple <Text delete>textual borrowing</Text>, the Quran{" "}
  <Text strong>reinterprets</Text>, <Text strong>recontextualizes</Text>, and{" "}
  <Text strong>redefines</Text> earlier stories, prophecies, and themes. It offers a{" "}
  <Text success>new perspective</Text>, one grounded in{" "}
  <Text code>monotheism</Text>, while responding to the changing{" "}
  <Text type="warning">socio-political landscape</Text> of{" "}
  <Text code>7th-century Arabia</Text>. This article will explore these allegations
  in depth, analyzing the Quran’s relationship with earlier traditions,
  addressing claims of <Text type="danger">plagiarism</Text>, and presenting a
  case for the Quran’s <Text strong>originality</Text> and{" "}
  <Text underline>divine authenticity</Text>.

        <Title level={4}>2. Refuting Key Plagiarism Claims</Title>

        <Title level={5}>2.1. Biblical Parallels: Correction Not Copying</Title>
        <Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Claim:</Text> One of the most common allegations against
  the <Text strong>Quran</Text> is that it simply <Text type="danger">copies stories</Text> from the{" "}
  <Text type="warning">Bible</Text>, particularly the accounts of{" "}
  <Text underline>Noah</Text>, <Text underline>Moses</Text>, and <Text underline>Jesus</Text>. Critics argue
  that the Quran’s retelling of these biblical narratives indicates that
  it is <Text type="danger">derivative</Text> and <Text delete>lacks originality</Text>.
  <br />
  <Text strong>Refutation:</Text>
  <br />- The Quran itself explicitly clarifies its role in relation to
  previous scriptures. It is not presented as a mere repetition of prior
  religious teachings but as a{" "}
  <Text mark>
    "confirmation of what came before it and a criterion over it."
  </Text>{" "}
  (<Text code>Quran 5:48</Text>). This means that the Quran acknowledges the{" "}
  <Text type="success">validity of prior revelations</Text> but also asserts its role as a{" "}
  <Text type="warning">corrective and final revelation</Text>, offering{" "}
  <Text strong>guidance</Text> to rectify deviations,
  misinterpretations, or incomplete teachings found in earlier texts.
  <br />- While the Quran shares several <Text mark>common stories</Text> with the
  Bible, there are <Text type="success">significant theological differences</Text> that distinguish
  Islamic teachings from Christian and Jewish doctrines. These
  differences are key to understanding the Quran’s{" "}
  <Text strong>unique position</Text>:
  <br />• <Text code>No original sin</Text> in Islam, as opposed to the doctrine of{" "}
  <Text type="danger">original sin</Text> in Christian theology (Romans 5:12). In
  Islamic thought, <Text type="success">all humans are born pure</Text>, without the{" "}
  <Text type="warning">inherited sin</Text> of Adam and Eve, a concept that
  fundamentally contrasts with Christian soteriology.
  <br />• <Text code>Jesus as prophet</Text>, not divine (<Text code>Quran 5:75</Text>).
  In contrast to the <Text type="danger">Christian view</Text> of Jesus as the{" "}
  <Text underline>Son of God</Text> and part of the <Text italic>divine Trinity</Text>, the Quran presents{" "}
  <Text strong>Jesus (Isa)</Text> as one of the greatest{" "}
  <Text type="success">prophets</Text> but emphatically <Text type="danger">rejects his divinity</Text>. This is a
  critical theological divergence that further reinforces the{" "}
  <Text strong>Quran's distinction</Text> from the Bible.
  <br />• <Text code>Different creation narrative</Text> (<Text code>Quran 2:29-33</Text>). The Quran offers
  an alternate version of the creation story, which differs in certain
  details from the <Text type="warning">Genesis account</Text>. For
  example, the Quran highlights the role of <Text strong>humanity’s stewardship</Text> over
  the earth, as well as emphasizing the story of <Text strong>Adam and Eve's fall</Text>{" "}
  from grace, with a focus on the lessons drawn from their{" "}
  <Text type="success">repentance</Text> rather than on the concept of{" "}
  <Text type="danger">inherited sin</Text>.
  <br />- Furthermore, the Quran addresses and <Text strong>corrects specific Biblical details</Text>{" "}
  that it considers <Text type="danger">inaccurate</Text> or{" "}
  <Text type="danger">misleading</Text>. For
  example, the Quran <Text type="warning">denies the crucifixion of Jesus</Text>, stating in{" "}
  <Text code>Surah 4:157</Text> that he was not crucified, but rather, it{" "}
  <Text mark>appeared so to the people</Text>. This stands in direct contrast to the{" "}
  <Text strong>central tenet of Christian doctrine</Text>, which holds the{" "}
  <Text italic>crucifixion and resurrection</Text> of Jesus as pivotal events for{" "}
  <Text strong>salvation</Text>.
  <br />
  <Text underline>In summary</Text>, while the Quran does share some{" "}
  <Text mark>common narratives</Text> with the Bible, it is <Text type="success">not a mere copy</Text> of the earlier
  scriptures. Instead, it offers a <Text type="success">unique theological perspective</Text>,{" "}
  <Text type="warning">corrects perceived errors</Text>, and provides a{" "}
  <Text strong>final revelation</Text> that reaffirms the essential{" "}
  <Text code>monotheism</Text> of all previous Abrahamic traditions while{" "}
  <Text type="danger">rejecting their theological distortions</Text>.

        <Title level={5}>
          2.2. Pre-Islamic Poetry: Linguistic Transformation
        </Title>
        <Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Claim:</Text> One of the frequent criticisms against the
  <Text strong> Quran</Text> is that its linguistic style closely resembles
  <Text type="warning"> pre-Islamic poetry</Text>. Critics argue that the Quran simply adopts
  elements of poetic form that were prevalent in the <Text underline>7th-century Arabian Peninsula</Text>, and
  hence, <Text type="danger">lacks originality</Text> in its language.
  <br />
  <Text strong>Refutation:</Text>
  <br />- While it is true that the Quran was revealed in a linguistic
  environment rich in poetry, the Quran's linguistic structure
  <Text type="success"> fundamentally differs</Text> from pre-Islamic poetry in several key ways:
  <br />• <Text code>Unique prose-poetry fusion</Text>: The Quran
  employs a <Text type="success">distinctive style</Text> that blends prose and poetry, yet it is
  not confined to traditional poetic conventions. This fusion results in
  a <Text type="warning">rhythm and eloquence</Text> that is unparalleled in classical Arabic
  literature. It conveys <Text strong>profound theological and philosophical messages</Text> in a way that <Text type="success">transcends</Text> 
  {" "}the typical artistic forms of poetry.
  <br />• <Text code>Grammatical precision</Text>: The Quranic text
  exhibits <Text type="success">grammatical precision</Text> and complexity that goes beyond the{" "}
  <Text type="warning">liberties usually taken in poetry</Text>. Unlike the flexible grammar of
  traditional Arabic poetry, which allows for <Text italic>deviations</Text> and <Text italic>artistic
  license</Text>, the Quran maintains a <Text strong>linguistic structure</Text> that is both
  {" "}<Text type="success">precise and sophisticated</Text>, adding another layer of complexity that
  sets it apart from pre-Islamic poetic forms.
  <br />• <Text code>Consistent monotheistic focus</Text>: The thematic
  content of the Quran is also <Text type="success">distinctly different</Text> from pre-Islamic
  poetry. Pre-Islamic poetry was often <Text type="danger">polytheistic</Text>, celebrating various
  gods and heroes of tribal Arabia. In <Text strong>stark contrast</Text>, the Quran
  emphasizes a <Text type="success">consistent monotheistic message</Text>, asserting the
  <Text underline>oneness of God (Allah)</Text> and rejecting <Text type="danger">polytheistic beliefs</Text> that were
  prevalent in the Arabian society of the time. This <Text strong>sharp contrast</Text> in
  themes further distinguishes the Quran from the prevailing poetic
  traditions.
  <br />- Additionally, the <Text strong>Prophet Muhammad’s illiteracy</Text>, as
  described by the term <Text mark>ummi</Text> in <Text code>Quran 7:157</Text>, makes the
  claim of direct copying from pre-Islamic poetry <Text type="danger">highly implausible</Text>.
  The Quran was revealed to an individual who was <Text type="warning">not literate</Text>, and
  therefore, could not have simply copied or adapted pre-existing poetic
  traditions. This fact adds a <Text type="success">layer of authenticity</Text> to the Quran's{" "}
  <Text strong>linguistic originality</Text> and <Text type="success">divine nature</Text>.
  <br />
  <Text underline>In conclusion</Text>, while the Quran's language is undoubtedly shaped by the
  linguistic environment of pre-Islamic Arabia, it represents a <Text type="success">unique
  and transformative departure</Text> from the poetry of the time. The Quran's
  <Text strong>linguistic style</Text> and <Text strong>thematic focus</Text> set it apart as a <Text type="success">divine
  revelation</Text> rather than a <Text type="danger">mere imitation</Text> of existing literary forms.
</Paragraph>


        <Title level={5}>
          2.3. Zoroastrian Influences: Shared Cultural Context
        </Title>
        <Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Claim:</Text> A common critique is that the <Text strong>Quran's depiction of Paradise and Hell</Text> reflects 
  {" "}<Text type="warning">direct borrowing</Text> from Zoroastrianism. Critics argue that the <Text type="danger">similarities</Text> between these 
  concepts in both traditions suggest that the Quran adopted these ideas from <Text underline>Zoroastrian beliefs</Text>, which were prevalent in 
  {" "}<Text italic>pre-Islamic Persia</Text>.
  <br />
  <Text strong>Refutation:</Text>
<br />- While it is true that certain similarities between the Quranic concept of Paradise and Hell and Zoroastrian teachings exist, 
  these should be understood within the broader context of <Text mark>common ancient Near Eastern motifs</Text> rather than as 
  {" "}<Text type="danger">direct borrowing</Text>. In fact, many civilizations in the ancient Near East, including Mesopotamian, Jewish, and 
  Persian cultures, <Text type="success">shared similar views</Text> on the afterlife, which were influenced by cultural exchanges over centuries.
  <br />
  - Furthermore, the Quran does not merely replicate Zoroastrian concepts but <Text type="success">radically transforms</Text> them. 
  Key distinctions include:
  <br />• <Text code>Strict monotheism</Text> vs. dualism:
  Zoroastrianism is fundamentally <Text type="danger">dualistic</Text>, positing the existence of two opposing forces—<Text strong>Ahura Mazda</Text> 
  (the good god) and <Text strong>Angra Mainyu</Text> (the evil spirit). In contrast, the Quran maintains a <Text type="success">strict monotheistic worldview</Text>, 
  asserting the <Text underline>absolute oneness of God (Allah)</Text>, with <Text type="danger">no room for dualism</Text>. This fundamental shift in 
  theological perspective <Text type="success">differentiates</Text> the Quranic account from Zoroastrian ideas.
<br />• <Text code>Ethical rather than ritual purity</Text> focus:
  Zoroastrianism emphasizes <Text type="warning">ritual purity</Text> and practices such as <Text italic>fire worship</Text> as essential to salvation, while 
  the Quran stresses <Text type="success">ethical conduct</Text>, <Text underline>personal accountability</Text>, and <Text strong>devotion to God</Text> 
  as the path to Paradise. The focus of the Quranic message is not on <Text delete>ritualistic acts</Text> but on 
  <Text type="success">righteousness, justice, and moral integrity</Text>.
<br />• <Text code>Different eschatological timeline</Text>: The Quran's eschatology—the timeline and events of the afterlife—
  differs <Text type="warning">significantly</Text> from Zoroastrian views. In Zoroastrianism, the afterlife is intertwined with a series 
  of cosmic events that culminate in the <Text italic>final renovation of the world</Text>. The Quran, while sharing an afterlife narrative, 
  presents a <Text type="success">distinct eschatological framework</Text> that emphasizes the <Text strong>individual’s actions</Text>, 
  the <Text underline>Day of Judgment</Text>, and the <Text strong>eternal consequences</Text> of one’s choices.
  <br />
  <Text underline>In conclusion</Text>, while there are some shared cultural motifs between Zoroastrianism and the Quran, the 
  {" "}<Text type="success">conceptual and theological differences</Text> between the two are profound. The Quran's treatment of Paradise and Hell, 
  and its broader theological framework, represent a <Text type="success">unique and transformative understanding</Text> that sets it apart from 
  Zoroastrianism and other contemporaneous religious systems.

          3. Theological and Historical Evidence Against Plagiarism
        </Title>

        <Title level={5}>3.1. The Quran's Unique Revelatory Mode</Title>
        <Paragraph>
  - <Text strong>Oral Revelation:</Text> The Quran was revealed piecemeal over a span of <Text type="warning">23 years</Text>, 
  a characteristic that <Text type="success">distinguishes it</Text> from other scriptures that were <Text delete>edited and compiled</Text> over time. 
  This mode of revelation, often delivered in response to <Text italic>specific events, questions, or circumstances</Text>, 
  reflects the <Text type="success">dynamic nature</Text> of the message. Unlike edited texts, the Quran maintains an 
  <Text type="success">organic flow</Text>, with its verses coming down at various intervals and offering guidance tailored to the 
  {" "}<Text underline>evolving needs of the Muslim community</Text>.
  <br />
  - <Text strong>Consistent Voice:</Text> One of the remarkable features of the Quran is its 
  {" "}<Text type="success">consistent use of the first-person divine voice</Text> throughout. The Quran presents itself as the 
  {" "}<Text mark>direct speech of God (Allah)</Text>, and this voice does not change across the 23 years of revelation. 
  This <Text italic>consistency</Text> lends a <Text type="success">unique sense of unity and coherence</Text> to the Quran, reinforcing its claim 
  to be the <Text underline>unaltered and eternal word of God</Text>. The divine voice resonates with both 
  <Text strong>immediacy and authority</Text>, offering <Text type="danger">clear and unequivocal instructions</Text> while maintaining a 
  <Text italic>sense of timelessness</Text>.
  <br />
  - <Text strong>Linguistic Miracle:</Text> The Quran's linguistic structure is considered an 
  {" "}<Text type="success">inimitable masterpiece</Text> (known as <Text mark>I'jaz</Text>). Its <Text italic>unique style, vocabulary, and rhythm</Text> 
  challenged contemporaries and continue to challenge scholars today. The Quran’s unmatched eloquence and 
  {" "}<Text strong>depth of meaning</Text> transcend ordinary linguistic abilities. This inimitability, which has yet to be 
  {" "}<Text delete>replicated or surpassed</Text> despite centuries of attempts, has been regarded as a 
  {" "}<Text type="success">sign of its divine origin</Text>. The Quranic text is both a <Text code>linguistic and intellectual challenge</Text> to its adversaries, 
  offering an <Text type="warning">unparalleled fusion of clarity, beauty, and depth</Text>. The concept of <Text mark>I'jaz</Text> 
  remains a central aspect of its <Text type="success">miraculous nature</Text>.
</Paragraph>

        <Title level={5}>3.2. Historical Impossibilities</Title>
        <Paragraph>
  - <Text strong>No Access:</Text> The Quran presents Biblical stories that, at times, differ 
  significantly from their 7th-century <Text type="warning">Christian and Jewish counterparts</Text>. 
  These discrepancies suggest that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) <Text type="success">could not have been exposed</Text> 
  {" "}to the versions of the Bible that were available in the Arabian Peninsula at the time. The Quranic accounts 
  of figures such as <Text italic>Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus</Text> present 
  {" "}<Text type="warning">unique details and variations</Text> not found in contemporary Judeo-Christian texts. 
  This poses a significant challenge to the claim of human authorship, as the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) had 
  {" "}<Text strong>no access to these alternate traditions</Text>, and his illiteracy (as described in the Quran itself) 
  further <Text type="danger">undermines the possibility of direct copying</Text> from written sources.
  <br />
  - <Text strong>Arabian Context:</Text> The Quran was revealed in a context that was <Text type="success">unique to 7th-century Arabia</Text>. 
  It directly addresses <Text code>societal issues, cultural practices, and religious beliefs</Text> 
  that were prevalent among the pagan, Jewish, and Christian communities in the Arabian Peninsula. 
  These issues—such as the <Text italic>status of women, idol worship, and care for orphans and the poor</Text>—were largely absent 
  from the scriptures of other traditions. The Quran’s engagement with these matters demonstrates a 
  {" "}<Text type="success">profound relevance</Text> to its immediate context, presenting <Text type="warning">solutions and guidance</Text> 
  {" "}that were <Text underline>entirely novel and directly applicable</Text> to the realities of the time. 
  This <Text strong>contextual focus</Text> suggests the Quran’s <Text type="success">divine origin</Text>, 
  as it transcends the conventional narrative structures found in other scriptures.
  <br />
  - <Text strong>Prophet's Character:</Text> The integrity and character of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) serve as a 
  {" "}<Text type="success">further indication</Text> that he could not have fabricated the Quran. Known for his honesty and trustworthiness, 
  he was widely recognized as <Text mark>"Al-Amin" (the Trustworthy)</Text> even by his adversaries before the revelation began. 
  His <Text italic>character and personal history</Text> provide compelling evidence against the possibility of deception 
  or self-interest in claiming authorship of the Quran. The <Text code>challenges and hardships</Text> he endured, as well as the 
  {" "}<Text type="warning">consistency and authenticity</Text> of his message, further reinforce the claim that the Quran could not 
  have been the product of <Text delete>human invention or manipulation</Text>.
</Paragraph>

        <Title level={4}>4. Academic Perspectives on Intertextuality</Title>
        <Paragraph>
  Modern scholarly approaches to religious texts emphasize the importance of 
  {" "}<Text mark>intertextuality</Text>, recognizing that all sacred scriptures engage in a 
  {" "}<Text italic>dynamic and complex dialogue</Text> with preceding traditions.
  <br />
  - The Quran’s relationship with earlier Abrahamic scriptures—such as the Torah and the Gospel—
  can be understood as part of a <Text strong>theological conversation</Text>, wherein the Quran 
  {" "}<Text type="success">reinterprets, corrects, and continues</Text> the narrative established in these texts. 
  This relationship is not one of <Text delete>direct borrowing or plagiarism</Text> but of a 
  {" "}<Text type="warning">transformative theological dialogue</Text>, wherein the Quran positions itself as 
  {" "}<Text mark>a confirmation and a criterion (Furqan)</Text> over previous scriptures, as stated in Quran 5:48.
  <br />
  - Intertextual engagement in the Quran can be compared to the way the New Testament engages with 
  the Hebrew Bible—<Text type="warning">reinterpreting</Text> and presenting earlier texts within a 
  {" "}<Text italic>new theological framework</Text>. Just as the New Testament does not plagiarize the Hebrew Bible 
  but offers a <Text type="success">new interpretation</Text> that fulfills and supersedes it, the Quran similarly 
  {" "}<Text type="success">transforms prior narratives</Text>, offering a <Text strong>more nuanced and clarified message</Text>.
  <br />
  - Furthermore, the Quranic engagement with earlier religious traditions is not merely corrective, 
  but serves as a form of <Text mark>revelatory enrichment</Text>, addressing 
  {" "}<Text italic>theological, moral, and narrative gaps</Text>, while providing a 
  {" "}<Text strong>final and comprehensive revelation</Text>. Scholars argue that this is an instance of religious texts 
  entering a <Text type="warning">profound dialogue</Text> with one another, where each new revelation 
  {" "}<Text type="success">refines and advances the understanding</Text> of divinity, ethics, and human nature.

          5. Conclusion: The Quran as Corrective Revelation
        </Title>
        <Paragraph>
  <Text mark>The plagiarism accusation against the Quran</Text> fails on several critical grounds, as it does not sufficiently explain the Quran’s <Text strong>profound uniqueness</Text> and <Text mark>distinct theological framework</Text>. These critiques overlook essential features of the Quran’s origin and nature:
  <br />
  <br />
  <Text code>1. Self-Conscious Corrective Purpose:</Text> The Quran explicitly defines itself as a <Text mark>"confirmation and criterion"</Text> (Quran 5:48) over earlier scriptures. It does not copy them but <Text strong>rectifies distortions</Text>, addressing <Text mark>theological inaccuracies</Text>, <Text mark>legal contradictions</Text>, and <Text mark>moral deviations</Text> found in previous texts. Its purpose is corrective and final—not imitative.
  <br />
  <br />
  <Text code>2. Radical Theological Innovations:</Text> The Quran introduces concepts that are <Text mark>absent or contradictory</Text> in prior scriptures. These include:
  <br />• <Text strong>Absolute monotheism</Text> (Tawheed) with no association to divine sons or incarnations.  
  <br />• A redefined understanding of <Text code>Jesus (‘Isa)</Text>—not crucified, not divine, but a prophet.  
  <br />• The rejection of <Text code>Trinitarian theology</Text> and <Text code>original sin</Text>.
  <br />
  These distinctions mark the Quran as a <Text mark>new theological paradigm</Text>.
  <br />
  <br />
  <Text code>3. Oral Culture Misinterpretation:</Text> The Quran was revealed in a <Text strong>pre-literate, oral society</Text> where storytelling was communal and memorized. While elements from earlier Abrahamic traditions were part of the cultural memory, the Quran’s <Text mark>style, sequence, and moral framework</Text> represent a <Text strong>divinely structured transformation</Text>, not a compilation of borrowed myths.
  <br />
  <br />
  <Text code>4. Linguistic Uniqueness (I'jaz al-Qur'an):</Text> The Quran’s language remains <Text mark>inimitable</Text>, even by its fiercest contemporaries. Its structure, cadence, and literary devices transcend all known Arabic styles—neither prose nor poetry but a divine hybrid. The challenge remains open (Quran 2:23): <Text code>"Produce a chapter like it."</Text>
  <br />
  <br />
  <Text strong>Conclusion:</Text> The Quran should be understood not as literary plagiarism, but as the <Text mark>final divine revelation</Text>. It:
  <br />• <Text strong>Confirms</Text> truths of previous scriptures  
  <br />• <Text strong>Corrects</Text> human distortions  
  <br />• <Text strong>Completes</Text> the divine message for all humanity  
  <br />
  Its <Text mark>linguistic brilliance</Text>, <Text mark>theological originality</Text>, and <Text mark>historical rootedness</Text> all testify to its authenticity. Far from being derivative, the Quran is <Text strong>a culmination of divine guidance</Text>, tailored to uplift and direct humanity through all eras.
