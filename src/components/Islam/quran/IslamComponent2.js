          Debunking the Claims of Plagiarism Against the Quran
        </Title>

        <Title level={4}>Abstract</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          This article critically addresses and refutes the recurring allegation
          that the Quran draws upon or plagiarizes earlier Judeo-Christian and
          Near Eastern religious traditions. Rather than simply reproducing
          pre-existing narratives,
          <Text mark>
            the Quran reconfigures them with distinct theological, moral, and
            narrative objectives, offering what scholars describe as corrective
            reinterpretation rather than replication.
          </Text>{" "}
          Through detailed textual analysis, historical contextualization, and
          linguistic scrutiny, this study illustrates the Quran’s unique
          exegetical approach and its deliberate theological positioning.
          {"\n\n"}
          The article further explores the Quran’s engagement with previous
          scriptures not as an act of borrowing, but as a divine dialogue that
          affirms, revises, or rejects earlier revelations in accordance with
          its own authoritative worldview. The Quran’s distinctive literary form
          (I'jaz al-Qur'an), unparalleled linguistic precision, and historical
          impact underscore its originality and invalidate simplistic
          accusations of textual borrowing or imitation. This analysis aims to
          contribute to a more nuanced and scholarly discourse surrounding
          scriptural originality and intertextuality in the Quran.

          1. Introduction: Understanding the Nature of the Allegations
        </Title>
        <Paragraph>
          The allegations that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) plagiarized or borrowed
          content from earlier religious and cultural traditions have long been
          a point of contention in scholarly and public discourse. These
          critiques often stem from the assumption that the Quran, as a
          religious and literary work, must be derivative in nature and a mere
          amalgamation of pre-existing ideas. Such claims include the accusation
          that the Quran contains elements borrowed from:
          {"\n\n"}
          <Text strong>- Judeo-Christian scriptures</Text> (including the Torah,
          Psalms, and Gospel), with some critics arguing that the Quran’s
          stories of the prophets and narratives of religious history are lifted
          directly from earlier texts.
          {"\n\n"}
          <Text strong>- Pre-Islamic Arabian poetry</Text> as well as the oral
          traditions of the Arabian Peninsula. This includes claims that the
          Quran’s style, rhythm, and certain phrases are influenced by the
          poetic conventions of the time, implying that its literary form is
          merely an adaptation of ancient Arabic poetic forms.
          {"\n\n"}
          <Text strong>
            - Zoroastrian and other regional religious traditions
          </Text>{" "}
          with assertions that themes found in the Quran, such as the duality of
          good and evil or the concepts of the afterlife, are taken from Persian
          and Mesopotamian religious thought. Critics point to supposed
          parallels in these ancient religious systems as evidence of the
          Quran's dependence on earlier mythologies and religious teachings.
          {"\n\n"}
          These critiques, while numerous, fundamentally misunderstand the
          nature of the Quran’s self-proclaimed divine mission. The Quran
          explicitly presents itself not as a mere continuation or repetition of
          past religious ideas but as a{" "}
          <Text mark>corrective continuation of divine revelation</Text> — a
          revelation that seeks to refine, clarify, and correct the theological,
          moral, and historical narratives presented in earlier scriptures. The
          Quran claims to be the final, unaltered word of God, revealing truths
          that were either distorted or lost over time, making it unique in both
          content and form.
          {"\n\n"}
          Rather than engaging in simple textual borrowing, the Quran
          reinterprets, recontextualizes, and redefines earlier stories,
          prophecies, and themes. It offers a new perspective, one grounded in
          monotheism, while responding to the changing socio-political landscape
          of 7th-century Arabia. This article will explore these allegations in
          depth, analyzing the Quran’s relationship with earlier traditions,
          addressing claims of plagiarism, and presenting a case for the Quran’s
          originality and divine authenticity.

        <Title level={4}>2. Refuting Key Plagiarism Claims</Title>

        <Title level={5}>2.1. Biblical Parallels: Correction Not Copying</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          <Text strong>Claim:</Text> One of the most common allegations against
          the Quran is that it simply copies stories from the Bible,
          particularly the accounts of Noah, Moses, and Jesus. Critics argue
          that the Quran’s retelling of these biblical narratives indicates that
          it is derivative and lacks originality.
          {"\n\n"}
          <Text strong>Refutation:</Text>
          {"\n"}- The Quran itself explicitly clarifies its role in relation to
          previous scriptures. It is not presented as a mere repetition of prior
          religious teachings but as a{" "}
          <Text mark>
            "confirmation of what came before it and a criterion over it."
          </Text>{" "}
          (Quran 5:48). This means that the Quran acknowledges the validity of
          prior revelations but also asserts its role as a corrective and final
          revelation, offering guidance to rectify deviations,
          misinterpretations, or incomplete teachings found in earlier texts.
          {"\n\n"}- While the Quran shares several common stories with the
          Bible, there are significant theological differences that distinguish
          Islamic teachings from Christian and Jewish doctrines. These
          differences are key to understanding the Quran’s unique position:
          {"\n\n"}• <Text code>No original sin</Text> in Islam, as opposed to
          the doctrine of original sin in Christian theology (Romans 5:12). In
          Islamic thought, all humans are born pure, without the inherited sin
          of Adam and Eve, a concept that fundamentally contrasts with Christian
          soteriology.
          {"\n"}• <Text code>Jesus as prophet</Text>, not divine (Quran 5:75).
          In contrast to the Christian view of Jesus as the Son of God and part
          of the divine Trinity, the Quran presents Jesus (Isa) as one of the
          greatest prophets but emphatically rejects his divinity. This is a
          critical theological divergence that further reinforces the Quran's
          distinction from the Bible.
          {"\n"}• <Text code>Different creation narrative</Text> (Quran
          2:29-33). The Quran offers an alternate version of the creation story,
          which differs in certain details from the Genesis account. For
          example, the Quran highlights the role of humanity’s stewardship over
          the earth, as well as emphasizing the story of Adam and Eve's fall
          from grace, with a focus on the lessons drawn from their repentance
          rather than on the concept of inherited sin.
          {"\n\n"}- Furthermore, the Quran addresses and corrects specific
          Biblical details that it considers inaccurate or misleading. For
          example, the Quran denies the crucifixion of Jesus, stating in Surah
          4:157 that he was not crucified, but rather, it appeared so to the
          people. This stands in direct contrast to the central tenet of
          Christian doctrine, which holds the crucifixion and resurrection of
          Jesus as pivotal events for salvation.
          {"\n\n"}
          In summary, while the Quran does share some common narratives with the
          Bible, it is not a mere copy of the earlier scriptures. Instead, it
          offers a unique theological perspective, corrects perceived errors,
          and provides a final revelation that reaffirms the essential
          monotheism of all previous Abrahamic traditions while rejecting their
          theological distortions.

        <Title level={5}>
          2.2. Pre-Islamic Poetry: Linguistic Transformation
        </Title>
        <Paragraph>
          <Text strong>Claim:</Text> One of the frequent criticisms against the
          Quran is that its linguistic style closely resembles pre-Islamic
          poetry. Critics argue that the Quran simply adopts elements of poetic
          form that were prevalent in the 7th-century Arabian Peninsula, and
          hence, lacks originality in its language.
          {"\n\n"}
          <Text strong>Refutation:</Text>
          {"\n"}- While it is true that the Quran was revealed in a linguistic
          environment rich in poetry, the Quran's linguistic structure
          fundamentally differs from pre-Islamic poetry in several key ways:
          {"\n\n"}• <Text code>Unique prose-poetry fusion</Text>: The Quran
          employs a distinctive style that blends prose and poetry, yet it is
          not confined to traditional poetic conventions. This fusion results in
          a rhythm and eloquence that is unparalleled in classical Arabic
          literature. It conveys profound theological and philosophical messages
          in a way that transcends the typical artistic forms of poetry.
          {"\n"}• <Text code>Grammatical precision</Text>: The Quranic text
          exhibits grammatical precision and complexity that goes beyond the
          liberties usually taken in poetry. Unlike the flexible grammar of
          traditional Arabic poetry, which allows for deviations and artistic
          license, the Quran maintains a linguistic structure that is both
          precise and sophisticated, adding another layer of complexity that
          sets it apart from pre-Islamic poetic forms.
          {"\n"}• <Text code>Consistent monotheistic focus</Text>: The thematic
          content of the Quran is also distinctly different from pre-Islamic
          poetry. Pre-Islamic poetry was often polytheistic, celebrating various
          gods and heroes of tribal Arabia. In stark contrast, the Quran
          emphasizes a consistent monotheistic message, asserting the oneness of
          God (Allah) and rejecting polytheistic beliefs that were prevalent in
          the Arabian society of the time. This sharp contrast in themes further
          distinguishes the Quran from the prevailing poetic traditions.
          {"\n\n"}- Additionally, the Prophet Muhammad’s illiteracy, as
          described by the term <Text mark>ummi</Text> in Quran 7:157, makes the
          claim of direct copying from pre-Islamic poetry highly implausible.
          The Quran was revealed to an individual who was not literate, and
          therefore, could not have simply copied or adapted pre-existing poetic
          traditions. This fact adds a layer of authenticity to the Quran's
          linguistic originality and divine nature.
          {"\n\n"}
          In conclusion, while the Quran's language is undoubtedly shaped by the
          linguistic environment of pre-Islamic Arabia, it represents a unique
          and transformative departure from the poetry of the time. The Quran's
          linguistic style and thematic focus set it apart as a divine
          revelation rather than a mere imitation of existing literary forms.

          2.3. Zoroastrian Influences: Shared Cultural Context
        </Title>
        <Paragraph>
          <Text strong>Claim:</Text> A common critique is that the Quran's
          depiction of Paradise and Hell reflects direct borrowing from
          Zoroastrianism. Critics argue that the similarities between these
          concepts in both traditions suggest that the Quran adopted these ideas
          from Zoroastrian beliefs, which were prevalent in pre-Islamic Persia.
          {"\n\n"}
          <Text strong>Refutation:</Text>
          {"\n"}- While it is true that certain similarities between the Quranic
          concept of Paradise and Hell and Zoroastrian teachings exist, these
          should be understood within the broader context of{" "}
          <Text mark>common ancient Near Eastern motifs</Text> rather than as
          direct borrowing. In fact, many civilizations in the ancient Near
          East, including Mesopotamian, Jewish, and Persian cultures, shared
          similar views on the afterlife, which were influenced by cultural
          exchanges over centuries.
          {"\n\n"}- Furthermore, the Quran does not merely replicate Zoroastrian
          concepts but radically transforms them. Key distinctions include:
          {"\n\n"}• <Text code>Strict monotheism</Text> vs. dualism:
          Zoroastrianism is fundamentally dualistic, positing the existence of
          two opposing forces—Ahura Mazda (the good god) and Angra Mainyu (the
          evil spirit). In contrast, the Quran maintains a strict monotheistic
          worldview, asserting the absolute oneness of God (Allah), with no room
          for dualism. This fundamental shift in theological perspective
          differentiates the Quranic account from Zoroastrian ideas.
          {"\n"}• <Text code>Ethical rather than ritual purity</Text> focus:
          Zoroastrianism emphasizes ritual purity and practices such as fire
          worship as essential to salvation, while the Quran stresses ethical
          conduct, personal accountability, and devotion to God as the path to
          Paradise. The focus of the Quranic message is not on ritualistic acts
          but on righteousness, justice, and moral integrity.
          {"\n"}• <Text code>Different eschatological timeline</Text>: The
          Quran's eschatology—the timeline and events of the afterlife—differs
          significantly from Zoroastrian views. In Zoroastrianism, the afterlife
          is intertwined with a series of cosmic events that culminate in the
          final renovation of the world. The Quran, while sharing an afterlife
          narrative, presents a distinct eschatological framework that
          emphasizes the individual’s actions, the Day of Judgment, and the
          eternal consequences of one’s choices.
          {"\n\n"}
          In conclusion, while there are some shared cultural motifs between
          Zoroastrianism and the Quran, the conceptual and theological
          differences between the two are profound. The Quran's treatment of
          Paradise and Hell, and its broader theological framework, represent a
          unique and transformative understanding that sets it apart from
          Zoroastrianism and other contemporaneous religious systems.

          3. Theological and Historical Evidence Against Plagiarism
        </Title>

        <Title level={5}>3.1. The Quran's Unique Revelatory Mode</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          - <Text strong>Oral Revelation:</Text> The Quran was revealed
          piecemeal over a span of 23 years, a characteristic that distinguishes
          it from other scriptures that were edited and compiled over time. This
          mode of revelation, often delivered in response to specific events,
          questions, or circumstances, reflects the dynamic nature of the
          message. Unlike edited texts, the Quran maintains an organic flow,
          with its verses coming down at various intervals and offering guidance
          tailored to the evolving needs of the Muslim community.
          {"\n\n"}- <Text strong>Consistent Voice:</Text> One of the remarkable
          features of the Quran is its consistent use of the first-person divine
          voice throughout. The Quran presents itself as the direct speech of
          God (Allah), and this voice does not change across the 23 years of
          revelation. This consistency lends a unique sense of unity and
          coherence to the Quran, reinforcing its claim to be the unaltered and
          eternal word of God. The divine voice resonates with both immediacy
          and authority, offering clear and unequivocal instructions while
          maintaining a sense of timelessness.
          {"\n\n"}- <Text strong>Linguistic Miracle:</Text> The Quran's
          linguistic structure is considered an inimitable masterpiece (known as{" "}
          <Text mark>I'jaz</Text>). Its unique style, vocabulary, and rhythm
          challenged contemporaries and continue to challenge scholars today.
          The Quran’s unmatched eloquence and depth of meaning transcend
          ordinary linguistic abilities. This inimitability, which has yet to be
          replicated or surpassed despite centuries of attempts, has been
          regarded as a sign of its divine origin. The Quranic text is both a
          linguistic and intellectual challenge to its adversaries, offering an
          unparalleled fusion of clarity, beauty, and depth. The concept of{" "}
          <Text mark>I'jaz</Text> remains a central aspect of its miraculous
          nature.
        </Paragraph>

        <Title level={5}>3.2. Historical Impossibilities</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          - <Text strong>No Access:</Text> The Quran presents Biblical stories
          that, at times, differ significantly from their 7th-century Christian
          and Jewish counterparts. These discrepancies suggest that the Prophet
          Muhammad (PBUH) could not have been exposed to the versions of the
          Bible that were available in the Arabian Peninsula at the time. The
          Quranic accounts of figures such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and
          Jesus present unique details and variations not found in contemporary
          Judeo-Christian texts. This poses a significant challenge to the claim
          of human authorship, as the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) had no access to
          these alternate traditions, and his illiteracy (as described in the
          Quran itself) further undermines the possibility of direct copying
          from written sources.
          {"\n\n"}- <Text strong>Arabian Context:</Text> The Quran was revealed
          in a context that was unique to 7th-century Arabia. It directly
          addresses societal issues, cultural practices, and religious beliefs
          that were prevalent among the pagan, Jewish, and Christian communities
          in the Arabian Peninsula. These issues, such as the status of women,
          the practice of idol worship, and the treatment of orphans and the
          poor, were largely absent from the scriptures of other traditions. The
          Quran’s engagement with these matters demonstrates a profound
          relevance to its immediate context, presenting solutions and guidance
          that were entirely novel and applicable to the realities of the time.
          This contextual focus suggests the Quran’s divine origin, as it
          transcends the conventional narrative structures found in other
          scriptures.
          {"\n\n"}- <Text strong>Prophet's Character:</Text> The integrity and
          character of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) serve as a further indication
          that he could not have fabricated the Quran. Known for his honesty and
          trustworthiness, he was widely recognized as "Al-Amin" (the
          Trustworthy) even by his adversaries before the revelation began. His
          character and his personal history provide compelling evidence against
          the possibility of deception or self-interest in claiming authorship
          of the Quran. The challenges and hardships he endured, as well as the
          consistency and authenticity of his message, further reinforce the
          claim that the Quran could not have been the product of human
          invention or manipulation.
        </Paragraph>

        <Title level={4}>4. Academic Perspectives on Intertextuality</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          Modern scholarly approaches to religious texts emphasize the
          importance of <Text mark>intertextuality</Text>, recognizing that all
          sacred scriptures engage in a dynamic and complex dialogue with
          preceding traditions.
          {"\n\n"}- The Quran’s relationship with earlier Abrahamic
          scriptures—such as the Torah and the Gospel—can be understood as part
          of a <Text strong>theological conversation</Text>, wherein the Quran
          reinterprets, corrects, and continues the narrative established in
          these texts. This relationship is not one of direct borrowing or
          plagiarism but of a transformative theological dialogue, wherein the
          Quran positions itself as a confirmation and a criterion (Furqan) over
          previous scriptures, as stated in Quran 5:48.
          {"\n\n"}- Intertextual engagement in the Quran can be compared to the
          way the New Testament engages with the Hebrew Bible, reinterpreting
          and presenting earlier texts within a new theological framework. Just
          as the New Testament does not plagiarize the Hebrew Bible but offers a
          new interpretation that fulfills and supersedes it, the Quran
          similarly transforms prior narratives, offering a more nuanced and
          clarified message.
          {"\n\n"}- Furthermore, the Quranic engagement with earlier religious
          traditions is not merely corrective, but serves as a form of{" "}
          <Text mark>revelatory enrichment</Text>, addressing theological,
          moral, and narrative gaps, while providing a final and comprehensive
          revelation. Scholars argue that this is an instance of religious texts
          entering a profound dialogue with one another, where each new
          revelation refines and advances the understanding of divinity, ethics,
          and human nature.

          5. Conclusion: The Quran as Corrective Revelation
        </Title>
        <Paragraph>
          The narrative of plagiarism levied against the Quran falls short on
          several critical grounds, as it fails to adequately account for the
          Quran’s profound uniqueness and its theological framework. The
          accusations neglect key aspects of the Quranic revelation and its
          distinct place in the broader history of religious texts.
          Specifically, the plagiarism narrative falters because:
          {"\n\n"}
          1. It disregards the Quran's{" "}
          <Text strong>self-conscious corrective purpose</Text>. The Quran
          itself explicitly positions its message as a continuation and
          rectification of earlier revelations, not as an imitation or
          reproduction of them. It is a final corrective revelation, aimed at
          addressing theological inaccuracies, legal contradictions, and moral
          deviations found in prior scriptures, as seen in its clarification of
          earlier narratives.
          {"\n\n"}
          2. It overlooks the Quran’s{" "}
          <Text strong>radical theological innovations</Text>. The Quran
          introduces profound theological concepts that distinguish it sharply
          from previous scriptures, particularly in its uncompromising
          monotheism, its rejection of the notion of divine incarnation
          (contrary to Christian theology), and its reinterpretation of key
          biblical stories (e.g., the nature of Jesus and his crucifixion).
          These theological innovations are integral to the Quran’s unique
          status, and they cannot be reduced to mere borrowing from previous
          traditions.
          {"\n\n"}
          3. It misinterprets the role of{" "}
          <Text strong>7th-century Arabian oral culture</Text>. The Quran
          emerged within a specific historical and cultural context—an oral
          tradition in pre-Islamic Arabia—where stories were shared, recited,
          and memorized. This context explains the Quran's intertextual
          relationship with earlier traditions, which were part of the cultural
          knowledge of the time. However, the Quran’s distinct linguistic form,
          structure, and message set it apart from these earlier sources.
          {"\n\n"}
          4. It neglects the Quran's <Text strong>linguistic uniqueness</Text>,
          which, despite containing shared narratives, demonstrates an
          inimitable style and eloquence. The Quran’s language is described as a
          linguistic miracle, exhibiting such depth and complexity that it
          challenges its critics to produce anything remotely similar, as
          evidenced in the Quranic challenge (Quran 2:23). The Quran’s
          linguistic structure transcends the literary norms of pre-Islamic
          poetry and prose, marking it as a text that cannot be attributed to
          human authorship or simple borrowing.
          {"\n\n"}
          In conclusion, the Quran should not be seen as a mere continuation of
          past traditions but rather as a <Text mark>final revelation</Text>—a
          text that affirms, corrects, and perfects divine guidance. Through its
          unique theological, linguistic, and historical context, the Quran
          provides a comprehensive and transformative message, one that
          addresses the needs of its time while offering timeless principles for
          humanity. Far from being a plagiarized work, it represents the
          culmination of divine revelation, tailored for the spiritual and moral
          needs of the human race in its entirety.
