        <hr />

        <Title level={4}>1. Introduction</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          The <Text strong>Qur'an</Text>, revered as the central scripture of
          Islam, presents itself not merely as a spiritual guide but as the{" "}
          <Text mark>literal, unaltered speech of God (Allah)</Text>, conveyed
          verbatim to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the Angel
          Gabriel over a period of 23 years (610–632 CE). Far from being a
          product of <Text italic>human contemplation</Text> or{" "}
          <Text italic>collective tradition</Text>, the Qur'an asserts its own
          <Text strong>divine origin</Text>, <Text strong>inimitability</Text>,
          and <Text strong>authority</Text> as the
          <Text type="warning">final and universal revelation</Text> — one that{" "}
          <Text underline>confirms and supersedes</Text> previous scriptures
          such as the Torah, Psalms, and the Gospel.
          {"\n\n"}For Muslims, the Qur'an is not simply a religious text but the{" "}
          <Text strong>epistemological foundation</Text> of all
          <Text italic>knowledge, ethics, and law</Text>. It speaks in the{" "}
          <Text strong>first person as God</Text>, offering:
          {"\n"} - <Text code>moral guidance</Text>
          {"\n"} - <Text code>legal ordinances</Text>
          {"\n"} - <Text code>historical narratives</Text>
          {"\n"} - <Text code>metaphysical truths</Text>
          {"\n"} - and <Text code>profound rhetorical structure</Text>. Its{" "}
          <Text type="success">unique linguistic form</Text> — neither poetry
          nor prose — defies categorization, and is considered by Muslim
          scholars as a <Text italic>miracle</Text> (<Text code>muʿjiza</Text>)
          accessible to all generations.
          {"\n\n"}Nonetheless,{" "}
          <Text type="danger">critics and secular academics</Text> have raised
          various objections to the Qur'an’s divine authorship. Some suggest
          that it reflects the{" "}
          <Text warning>sociocultural context of 7th-century Arabia</Text> or{" "}
          <Text warning>borrowings from Judeo-Christian traditions</Text>.
          Others critique its <Text warning>scientific references</Text>,{" "}
          <Text warning>literary claims</Text>, or the
          <Text warning>methodology of its transmission and compilation</Text>.
          {"\n\n"}This article undertakes a{" "}
          <Text strong>comprehensive, interdisciplinary examination</Text> of
          these claims and counterclaims by analyzing:
          {"\n"} - The Qur'an’s <Text strong>internal assertions</Text> of
          divine origin and literary inimitability.
          {"\n"} - Its <Text strong>linguistic structure</Text>,{" "}
          <Text strong>rhetorical brilliance</Text>, and stylistic singularity.
          {"\n"} - The <Text strong>integrity</Text> and{" "}

          <Text code>historical</Text>, <Text code>textual</Text>, and
          <Text code>philosophical challenges</Text>.{"\n\n"}By engaging with
          both <Text strong>classical Islamic scholarship</Text> and{" "}
          <Text strong>contemporary academic discourse</Text>, this study seeks
          to assess whether the Qur'an stands as a{" "}
          <Text type="success">genuinely divine revelation</Text> or a
          <Text type="warning">
            remarkable, yet human, artifact of religious literature
          </Text>
          .
        </Paragraph>

        <Title level={4}>2. The Qur'an's Claim of Divine Authorship</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          The <Text strong>Qur'an</Text> asserts its{" "}
          <Text strong>divine authorship</Text>{" "}
          <Text type="success">unequivocally</Text> and
          <Text strong> repeatedly</Text> throughout its text. Unlike other
          religious scriptures that often present
          <Text italic>third-person attributions</Text> or are seen as{" "}
          <Text italic>compilations of various authors</Text>, the Qur'an speaks
          in the <Text strong>direct and authoritative voice of God</Text> —
          often using the
          <Text code>plural of majesty (“We”)</Text> to assert{" "}
          <Text strong>divine agency</Text>. This linguistic form is not merely
          stylistic; it reflects the Qur'an’s{" "}
          <Text mark>self-identification as a revelation</Text> from the
          <Text strong> Creator to all of humanity</Text>.{"\n\n"} -{" "}
          <Text mark>
            “Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an, and indeed, We will be

            “And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our

            witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful.”
          </Text>{" "}
          (Qur'an 2:23)
          {"\n\n"}These verses are not mere{" "}
          <Text italic>theological assertions</Text>; they are{" "}
          <Text strong>bold epistemological claims</Text>. The Qur'an not only
          claims <Text strong>divine origin</Text> but simultaneously{" "}
          <Text type="danger">challenges skeptics</Text> to{" "}
          <Text strong>verify</Text> or <Text strong>falsify</Text> this claim
          through <Text code>literary, rational, and historical means</Text>.
          Its demand for imitation — even of a single chapter — is{" "}
          <Text type="warning">unparalleled in ancient literature</Text>.
          {"\n\n"}Unlike the Bible, which comprises{" "}
          <Text italic>
            historical narratives, parables, genealogies, and letters
          </Text>{" "}
          often attributed to multiple authors, the Qur'an presents itself as{" "}
          <Text mark>a single, coherent discourse authored by God Himself</Text>
          . Its <Text strong>consistency</Text>,{" "}
          <Text strong>rhetorical sophistication</Text>, and{" "}
          <Text strong>unapologetic divine voice</Text>
          serve as central pillars in its claim of being the{" "}
          <Text type="success">final revelation to mankind</Text>.
        </Paragraph>

        <Title level={4}>3. Qur'an’s Unmatched Challenge</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          The <Text strong>Qur'an</Text> boldly issues a challenge unlike any
          other in religious history:{" "}
          <Text mark>
            “If you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant,
            then produce a chapter like it.” (Qur'an 2:23)
          </Text>{" "}
          This is not <Text italic>poetic flair</Text> — it's a{" "}
          <Text strong>direct intellectual confrontation</Text>. For over{" "}
          <Text strong>1,400 years</Text>, critics, linguists, and enemies of
          Islam have
          <Text type="danger"> failed to meet this challenge</Text>. Despite

          <Text strong>
            no one — not a scholar, not an empire — has succeeded in imitating
            its linguistic precision, unparalleled eloquence, prophetic depth,

          have either <Text type="danger">ignored </Text>the challenge or made
          feeble attempts that collapse under scrutiny.
          {"\n\n"}This failure is not just <Text italic>poetic</Text> — it’s{" "}
          <Text strong>empirical</Text>. The Qur’an is not a book born of

          that{" "}
          <Text type="success">transcends time, politics, and geography</Text>.{" "}
          <Text underline>
            If this were man-made, why has no one matched it — even with modern
            AI, literary academies, and centuries of opposition?
          </Text>{" "}
          The challenge still <Text strong>STANDS</Text> — and their{" "}

            silence is{" "}

        <Title level={4}>4. Linguistic and Literary Uniqueness</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          The <Text strong>Qur'an's linguistic form</Text> has long been
          regarded by scholars as a{" "}
          <Text type="success">singular literary phenomenon</Text>. Its{" "}
          <Text strong>eloquence</Text>,<Text strong> structure</Text>, and{" "}
          <Text strong>stylistic innovation</Text> are not merely artistic
          traits, but{" "}
          <Text underline>central to its claim of divine origin</Text>.
          Classical Arabic scholars, as well as modern linguists, have attested
          to its <Text type="warning">unmatched composition</Text>, which

          The Qur'an challenges humanity to produce a text like it — even a

        <Title level={4}>6. Scientific Accuracy in the Quran</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          One of the most compelling arguments presented by Muslim scholars for
          the divine origin of the Quran lies in its numerous references to
          natural phenomena and scientific facts that align with modern
          discoveries — despite having been revealed in the 7th century, in a
          society lacking formal scientific knowledge.
          {"\n\n"} - <Text mark>Embryological Development:</Text> The Quran
          provides detailed stages of human embryonic growth in verses such as{" "}
          <Text underline>Quran 23:12–14</Text>, describing the transformation
          from a drop of fluid to a "clinging clot" (*alaqah*), then a
          "chewed-like lump" (*mudghah*). Modern embryology, pioneered in part
          by Prof. Keith Moore, has noted the striking accuracy of these
          descriptions, which mirror stages now visible through microscopes — a
          technology unavailable at the time.
          {"\n"} - <Text mark>Cosmology and the Expanding Universe:</Text> In{" "}
          <Text underline>Quran 51:47</Text>, the verse “And We are expanding
          it” is interpreted by many scholars to refer to the continuous
          expansion of the universe, a concept only confirmed in the 20th
          century through Edwin Hubble’s redshift observations. This reference
          predates modern cosmology by over a millennium.
          {"\n"} - <Text mark>Origin of the Universe:</Text> The Quran mentions
          that the heavens and the earth were once a "joined entity" before
          being split apart (<Text underline>Quran 21:30</Text>), which
          parallels the widely accepted Big Bang theory — the idea that the
          universe originated from a singularity and expanded outward.
          {"\n"} - <Text mark>Oceanography:</Text> The Quran describes internal
          waves in the deep sea, layered darkness, and the separation between
          salt and fresh water bodies (<Text underline>Quran 24:40</Text>,{" "}
          <Text underline>Quran 55:19–20</Text>). These phenomena were confirmed
          only after deep-sea exploration and advanced hydrology research.
          {"\n"} - <Text mark>Mountains and Geological Stability:</Text>{" "}
          Described metaphorically as pegs or stakes (
          <Text underline>Quran 78:6–7</Text>), mountains are now understood to
          stabilize the Earth’s crust via their deep roots, consistent with
          principles of isostasy in geology.
          {"\n\n"}While the Quran is not a science textbook, its remarkable
          correlation with scientific facts — many of which were discovered over
          1,000 years later — has led various scientists and scholars to
          reconsider its origins.
          {"\n\n"}*"The Quranic descriptions are in agreement with modern
          scientific discoveries, and this consistency is difficult to attribute
          to human knowledge of the 7th century."* —{" "}

        <Title level={4}>7. Prophetic Accuracy in the Quran</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          In addition to its linguistic, historical, and scientific features,
          the Quran also contains numerous prophecies — specific, time-bound
          predictions that were later fulfilled — lending credence to its claim
          of divine origin. Unlike vague generalities or post-event editing,
          many of these prophecies were revealed during periods of crisis or
          uncertainty, making their fulfillment even more remarkable.
          {"\n\n"} - <Text mark>The Roman-Persian Conflict:</Text> One of the
          most famous examples is found in <Text underline>Quran 30:2–4</Text>,
          which predicted the unlikely comeback of the Romans after a
          humiliating defeat by the Persians. The verse states, "The Romans have
          been defeated. In the nearest land. But they, after their defeat, will
          overcome. Within a few years..." (Arabic: *bid‘a sinīn* — 3 to 9
          years). At the time, Roman recovery seemed impossible, yet within
          seven years, Emperor Heraclius successfully recaptured lost
          territories, fulfilling the prophecy within the predicted timeframe.
          {"\n"} - <Text mark>Victory of Islam:</Text> In early Meccan years,
          when Muslims were weak and persecuted, the Quran predicted their
          eventual dominance:{" "}
          <Text underline>
            “They want to extinguish the light of Allah... But Allah will
            perfect His light.”
          </Text>{" "}
          (Quran 9:32). This assertion was fulfilled within a few decades, as
          Islam rapidly expanded beyond Arabia, reaching Persia, the Levant, and
          North Africa.
          {"\n"} - <Text mark>Abu Lahab’s Fate:</Text> The Quran singled out a
          specific individual, Abu Lahab, for condemnation in{" "}
          <Text underline>Quran 111</Text>, declaring he would never accept
          Islam and would die a disbeliever. This prophecy held true until his
          death despite having ample opportunity to disprove it by merely
          pretending to convert — something that would have contradicted the
          Quran’s verse.
          {"\n"} - <Text mark>Protection of the Quran:</Text> The claim that God
          Himself would preserve the Quran from corruption (
          <Text underline>Quran 15:9</Text>) has stood the test of time, with
          textual consistency verified across centuries and geographies,
          including ancient manuscripts like the Topkapi, Sana’a, and Birmingham
          fragments.
          {"\n"} - <Text mark>Signs of the End Times:</Text> The Quran,
          supplemented by Hadith literature, contains descriptions of moral
          decay, global communication, economic injustice, and widespread
          immorality that align closely with contemporary social trends. While
          such predictions are broad, their convergence with modern patterns is
          considered compelling by many scholars.
          {"\n\n"}In religious studies, a prophecy is considered strong evidence
          of divine revelation when it is: 1) specific, 2) made before the
          event, 3) beyond the capacity of contemporary knowledge or
          expectation, and 4) fulfilled in verifiable historical contexts. Many
          Quranic prophecies meet these criteria, thereby challenging the theory
          of purely human authorship.
          {"\n\n"}*“The predictive elements in the Quran are clear, bold, and
          historically verified. Such precision is hard to explain through
          guesswork or coincidence.”* —{" "}

        <Title level={4}>8. Counterarguments and Responses</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          While the Quran presents strong internal and external evidences of
          divine origin, critics have raised various objections over the
          centuries. These critiques, however, are often met with detailed
          scholarly responses that address the historical, theological, and
          linguistic dimensions of the text.
          {"\n\n"} -{" "}
          <Text mark>Alleged Borrowing from Judeo-Christian Sources:</Text> Some
          critics claim that the Quran draws heavily from earlier Abrahamic
          scriptures, particularly the Bible and apocryphal literature. However,
          while thematic parallels exist, the Quran frequently corrects
          theological points — such as denying the divinity of Jesus, rejecting
          the crucifixion, and emphasizing strict monotheism. Scholars note that
          rather than copying, the Quran engages in a form of divine commentary
          and rectification of past revelations.
          {"\n"} - <Text mark>Historicity and Cultural Context:</Text>{" "}
          Detractors often argue that the Quran is a product of its time — the
          7th-century Arabian milieu. Yet, the Quran introduces concepts like
          universal human dignity, due process, just war, and rights of women,
          orphans, and slaves — values that were revolutionary and often in
          tension with the norms of that era. This anachronistic moral vision
          suggests something beyond its socio-political context.
          {"\n"} - <Text mark>Claims of Literary Influence:</Text> While
          pre-Islamic Arabic poetry existed, no contemporary or classical source
          demonstrates the unique linguistic blend of prose and rhythmic
          eloquence found in the Quran. Even celebrated poets like al-Khansa and
          Labid reportedly ceased composing poetry after hearing it,
          acknowledging its unparalleled style. The Quran’s structure, coherence
          (nazm), and thematic depth have resisted imitation for over 1,400
          years.
          {"\n"} - <Text mark>Contradictions and Consistency:</Text> Critics
          frequently search for internal inconsistencies. However, classical
          Muslim scholars have responded that apparent contradictions are due to
          misinterpretation, lack of context, or mistranslation. The Quran
          itself challenges:{" "}
          <Text italic>
            “Do they not reflect upon the Quran? Had it been from other than
            Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction.”
          </Text>{" "}
          (Quran 4:82). No definitive contradiction has been upheld in scholarly
          critique.
          {"\n\n"}Ultimately, the durability of these counterarguments is
          weakened by the Quran’s demonstrated preservation, influence, and
          internal coherence. As academic discourse increasingly explores
          religious texts within both literary and metaphysical frameworks, the
          Quran remains uniquely resistant to purely naturalistic or humanistic
          explanations.
        </Paragraph>

        <Title level={4}>8. Conclusion</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          The Quran stands as a text of unparalleled historical, linguistic,
          theological, and philosophical significance. Its self-referential
          claims of divine authorship are supported by a constellation of
          factors: its remarkable preservation through oral and written
          transmission, its linguistic form that has resisted imitation for over
          fourteen centuries, its alignment with certain modern scientific
          insights, and its accurate prophetic declarations. These elements
          collectively present a challenge not merely to produce a verse like
          it, but to account for its enduring impact through purely naturalistic
          or socio-historical models.
          {"\n\n"} While critics propose theories of human authorship, literary
          borrowing, or cultural contextualization, these explanations fall
          short of addressing the Quran’s internal coherence, structural unity,
          and moral universality. The fact that the Quran was revealed to an
          unlettered man in 7th-century Arabia — with no access to global
          knowledge or literary tools — heightens the question of authorship and
          origins. The burden of proof, therefore, shifts to the skeptic: how
          could such a multifaceted and transformative text emerge from such
          conditions if not from a divine source?
          {"\n\n"} For more than a billion Muslims, the Quran is not simply a
          historical scripture; it is the{" "}
          <Text mark>living, unaltered, and eternal Word of God</Text>, offering
          guidance, clarity, and spiritual depth for all times and peoples. As
          both a religious text and an intellectual phenomenon, it continues to
          invite reflection, study, and—ultimately—humility before its message.
