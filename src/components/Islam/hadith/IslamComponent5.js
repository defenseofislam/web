<Paragraph>
  In Islamic tradition, the generation of the Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) companions—known as the <Text underline>Sahabah</Text>—holds a uniquely honored place. They were the first to embrace Islam, walked closely with the Prophet, witnessed the revelation of the Qur’an firsthand, and sacrificed everything for the faith. The Prophet ﷺ himself declared:

  <Text code>“The best of my nation are my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.”</Text>
  <Text italic>[Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 3654]</Text>

  <Text strong>Indeed, spiritually and morally, the Sahabah are the gold standard for all Muslims.</Text> Their sincerity, faith, and courage remain <Text mark>unmatched in history</Text>. Yet, when it comes to <Text warning>leadership</Text>, <Text type="success">military strength</Text>, and establishing a global era of justice, Islamic eschatology speaks of a remarkable future—one in which the best leadership and army will emerge in the figure of <Text type="danger">Al Mahdi</Text> and his forces.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
  This profound contrast between past excellence and future promise continues to inspire and shape the Muslim worldview today.

<Text underline><Title level={4}>1. The Best Leader and Army in the End Times</Title></Text>

<Paragraph>
 <Text mark>Prophetic traditions clearly describe Al Mahdi</Text> as a <Text strong>divinely guided leader</Text> who will restore justice, righteousness, and true Islam in the world during a time of <Text warning>great turmoil and oppression</Text>. The Prophet ﷺ said about Al Mahdi’s forces:

 <Text code>“The best of armies is the army of Al Mahdi.”</Text>
— [<Text type="success">Hasan</Text>; reported by Ahmad]

And also:

 <Text underline>“There will be a group from my Ummah who will fight for the truth and remain steadfast until Allah grants victory or they die as martyrs.”</Text>
 [<Text italic>Sahih Muslim, Hadith 185</Text>]

<Text type="danger">{" "}These narrations indicate that Al Mahdi’s army is not only powerful but also supremely righteous and victorious.</Text> Their conquest of oppressors, establishment of peace, and restoration of justice will be unlike anything the world has witnessed before.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
 A future defined by divine justice and ultimate triumph.

  <Title level={4}>2. Comparing the Generations</Title>
</Text>
<Paragraph>
While the <Text underline>Sahabah’s era</Text> was the dawn of Islam’s light, characterized by <Text strong>unparalleled spiritual purity</Text> and foundational struggles, <Text mark>Al Mahdi’s time</Text> will be the era of fulfillment and <Text type="success">global justice</Text>—the harvest after the sowing.{" "}

This future leadership will be marked by:{" "}

<Text warning>Unity and justice</Text> that heals the world’s divisions{" "}
<Text italic>Rapid and almost effortless victories</Text> supported by divine aid{" "}
<Text type="danger">The establishment of true peace</Text>, where fairness prevails globally{" "}

<Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
These qualities place Al Mahdi’s leadership and his army in a category of their own—the best in the political and military sense.

<Text type="danger">The Sahabah showed us this in their time;</Text> now, it is our turn to prepare for and contribute to the coming era.
