        <Title level={4}>Abstract</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          The assertion of <Text strong>Deism</Text>—the belief in a Creator God
          who does not intervene in the universe and the rejection of organized
          religion—presents a philosophical stance that distances itself from
          both theism and atheism. Deists often argue that human reason and
          observation of the natural world are sufficient to conclude the
          existence of a God, while dismissing revealed religions as human
          constructs. However, this perspective faces significant challenges.
          This article systematically refutes the Deist worldview by examining
          the following points: the necessity of{" "}
          <Text mark>divine revelation</Text> in understanding God’s will, the
          limitations of human reason in comprehending the divine, and the
          contradiction inherent in believing in a personal Creator yet denying
          His involvement in human affairs. Through philosophical, theological,
          and empirical analysis, the article demonstrates that belief in God is
          inseparable from <Text mark>faith in His ongoing relationship</Text>{" "}
          with creation, which is most fully expressed through religious
          revelation and practice. This article argues that Deism overlooks the
          inherent spiritual need for direct communication with the Creator,
          which is central to human existence and moral guidance. Ultimately,
          this refutation underscores the argument that while Deism provides an
          intellectually appealing alternative to religion, it falls short in
          addressing the depth of human spiritual experience and the necessity
          of divine revelation in guiding humanity’s purpose and destiny.

          1. Introduction: Understanding the Nature of the Deist / Theist but
          Not a Religious Follower
        </Title>
        <Paragraph>
          The concept of <Text strong>Deism</Text> and{" "}
          <Text strong>Theism</Text> without adherence to any specific religious
          tradition is a philosophical stance that holds significant
          implications in both theological and sociological discussions. A Deist
          or Theist, in this context, acknowledges the existence of a divine
          Creator or supreme being but rejects organized religion as a necessary
          means of connecting with that Creator. This position is predicated on
          the belief that the universe itself, through natural laws and
          observable phenomena, reflects the existence of God. Therefore,{" "}
          <Text mark>reason</Text> and <Text mark>rational thought</Text> are
          seen as sufficient for understanding the Creator, without the need for{" "}
          <Text strong>divinely revealed scripture</Text> or religious
          practices. However, this perspective faces several key challenges. The
          rejection of <Text strong>organized religion</Text> is often seen as a
          response to the perceived inconsistencies, contradictions, and
          cultural biases present in many religious systems. Yet, Deists and
          non-religious Theists must contend with the inherent{" "}
          <Text mark>subjectivity of human reason</Text>, as it is often limited
          in its ability to grasp the <Text strong>transcendent nature</Text> of
          God or the ultimate purpose of human existence. Furthermore, the
          denial of religious <Text strong>revelation</Text> introduces a
          paradox: if God is to be known, how can one truly know the Creator
          without a direct form of communication that transcends human
          intellectual capacity? This introduction will examine the core ideas
          behind Deism and Theism without religious affiliation, exploring both
          the intellectual and theological underpinnings of such beliefs. It
          will also address the limitations of relying solely on reason to
          comprehend divine intent and purpose, and the role of{" "}
          <Text mark>faith</Text> and <Text strong>revelation</Text> in
          understanding God’s will. Through a multidisciplinary lens, this
          exploration will challenge the assertion that human reason alone can
          provide a complete and accurate picture of the divine.

        <Title level={4}>2. What is the Source of Belief? Assumptions?</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          The source of belief is a complex and multifaceted topic that has
          intrigued philosophers, psychologists, and theologians for centuries.
          At its core, belief is the mental acceptance of a proposition, claim,
          or truth without immediate empirical evidence or proof. Beliefs are
          foundational to human cognition, influencing not only individual
          decisions but also societal norms, cultural practices, and collective
          ideologies. This article aims to explore the various sources from
          which belief arises, including{" "}
          <Text strong>innate cognitive processes</Text>,{" "}
          <Text mark>cultural influences</Text>,{" "}
          <Text mark>personal experiences</Text>, and{" "}
          <Text strong>revelatory experiences</Text>. <br /> <br />
          <Text strong>2.1. Cognitive Foundations of Belief:</Text>A significant
          portion of human belief is shaped by the brain's innate cognitive
          architecture. The human mind is predisposed to forming beliefs based
          on <Text strong>patterns</Text> and <Text mark>assumptions</Text>.
          From a psychological standpoint, the{" "}
          <Text strong>confirmation bias</Text> and the tendency to seek
          coherence and consistency in one's worldview significantly influence
          belief formation. The cognitive mechanism of "belief perseverance"
          suggests that once beliefs are formed, individuals are resistant to
          changing them, even in the face of contradictory evidence.
          <br /> <br />
          <Text strong>2.2. Cultural Influences:</Text>
          Social and cultural factors also play a crucial role in shaping belief
          systems. From a young age, individuals are exposed to cultural
          narratives and societal frameworks that inform their understanding of
          the world. These frameworks often include religious doctrines,
          societal values, and scientific paradigms. The{" "}
          <Text mark>socialization process</Text>—including the influence of
          family, education, and community—contributes to the solidification of
          belief systems. Cultural beliefs are often taken as self-evident
          truths within a particular group, and deviations from these beliefs
          can be met with social resistance or exclusion.
          <br /> <br />
          <Text strong>2.3. Personal Experience and Empathy:</Text>
          Individual experience also serves as a powerful source of belief.
          Personal encounters, whether emotional, spiritual, or empirical, shape
          how individuals perceive reality. For instance, religious or mystical
          experiences are often described as direct encounters with the divine
          or transcendent, leading individuals to adopt beliefs rooted in those
          experiences. Additionally, empathetic engagement with others'
          experiences can foster beliefs based on shared understanding and
          emotional resonance.
          <br /> <br />
          <Text strong>2.4. Assumptions and Presuppositions:</Text>
          Belief formation is often based on underlying{" "}
          <Text mark>assumptions</Text>—unquestioned premises that shape how we
          interpret new information. These assumptions act as filters through
          which all incoming data is processed. For example, an individual's
          assumption about the nature of humanity (whether inherently good or
          corrupt) will profoundly affect their beliefs about society, morality,
          and justice. Assumptions are not always explicit or conscious, but
          they serve as the foundation for the development of larger belief
          systems.
          <br /> <br />
          <Text strong>2.5. Religious and Revelatory Beliefs:</Text>
          In many cultures, religious belief is viewed as a source that
          transcends the ordinary cognitive and experiential processes.
          Individuals who adhere to religious traditions often believe that
          their belief systems are not the result of human reasoning or cultural
          construction but are derived from divine revelation or sacred texts.
          These beliefs are assumed to be directly communicated by a higher
          power and are considered by believers to be infallible truths. As
          such, they provide the foundation for religious faith, rituals, and
          moral conduct.
          <br /> <br />
          <Text strong>2.6. Conclusion:</Text>
          <Paragraph>
            Belief doesn’t come from a single source—it’s shaped by a mix of
            things. Our minds are naturally wired to search for meaning, but our
            environment, upbringing, culture, and personal life experiences also
            play a huge role. For many, spiritual or religious moments give
            belief a deeper foundation. Behind every belief, though, are
            assumptions—often unspoken—that guide how we see the world and our
            place in it.
            <br />
            <br />
            To truly understand where beliefs come from, we need to look at it
            from many angles: psychology, sociology, philosophy, and even
            theology. These assumptions form the lens through which we view
            life, purpose, and identity. That’s why it’s important not just to
            ask *what* someone believes—but *why*.
          </Paragraph>
        </Paragraph>

        <Title level={4}>3. Do Deists Believe in Heaven and Hell?</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          Most Deists believe in a Creator or higher power but reject organized
          religion and its doctrines—including the idea of Heaven and Hell as
          described in scriptures. Since Deism emphasizes reason, personal
          reflection, and natural laws over revelation or religious texts, the
          concepts of an eternal paradise or punishment are usually seen as{" "}
          <Text mark>human inventions rather than divine truths</Text>.
          <br />
          <br />
          To many Deists, life after death—if it exists—is a mystery that can't
          be confirmed or denied through reason alone. Some might believe in a
          spiritual continuation or some form of moral accountability in the
          afterlife, but they typically don't accept the detailed religious
          descriptions of Heaven and Hell.
          <br />
          <br />
          Instead of focusing on rewards and punishments, Deists tend to
          emphasize <Text strong>living ethically in this life</Text>, guided by
          conscience, rational thought, and a sense of universal justice. For
          them, belief in Heaven or Hell isn’t necessary to be moral—it’s more
          about doing good because it’s right, not because of what might happen
          afterward.
          <br /> <br /> While the Deist approach values{" "}
          <Text strong>reason, personal autonomy</Text>, and skepticism toward
          institutionalized religion, its dismissal of Heaven and Hell raises
          important questions—both moral and existential.
          <br />
          <br />
          <Text underline>First</Text>, without any concept of ultimate
          accountability, there’s a concern that moral responsibility becomes
          entirely subjective. If there is no divine justice—no reward for the
          oppressed and no punishment for the corrupt—then what guarantees that
          good will ultimately prevail? As humans, we deeply crave{" "}
          <Text mark>cosmic fairness</Text>, especially in a world where
          injustice often goes unpunished.
          <br />
          <br />
          <Text underline>Second</Text>, the rejection of an afterlife can lead
          to a kind of existential nihilism. If this life is all there is, then
          questions of meaning, purpose, and morality can become
          fragile—especially when people face suffering, loss, or injustice.{" "}
          <Text strong>
            What do we live for if nothing ultimately matters beyond this brief
            existence?
          </Text>
          <br />
          <br />
          <Text underline>Finally</Text>, from a theological perspective,
          denying Heaven and Hell also{" "}
          <Text type="danger">
            dismisses centuries of moral philosophy and divine revelation
          </Text>{" "}
          offered by religious traditions. It assumes that human reason alone is
          sufficient to define right and wrong—an assumption many thinkers
          challenge.
          <br />
          <br />
          In essence, while Deism offers intellectual freedom, its denial of a
          structured afterlife opens up deep dilemmas about justice, morality,
          and the ultimate meaning of life.
        </Paragraph>

        <Title level={4}>4. Deism and the Invention of a Subjective God</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          Deism, by its very nature, removes all objective revelation or
          scripture as the source of understanding God, leaving each individual
          to define the Creator based on their own interpretation, imagination,
          or desire.
          <Text strong>
            As a result, Deism does not lead to a unified or coherent view of
            God,
          </Text>{" "}
          but rather a spectrum of contradictory and sometimes even disturbing
          portrayals.
          {"\n\n"}- <Text mark>Some deists claim God is one</Text>, others argue
          there are multiple divine forces.{"\n"}- Some describe God as{" "}
          <Text code>male</Text>, others as <Text code>female</Text>, and a few
          even propose <Text code>animalistic or impersonal cosmic forces</Text>
          .{"\n"}- In more extreme cases, some so-called deists attribute{" "}
          <Text type="danger">immoral or perverse characteristics</Text> to
          God—claiming, for instance, that He is cruel, unjust, or even a
          "rapist" due to their misinterpretations of divine power or
          intervention.{"\n\n"}
          <Text strong>
            This complete subjectivization of God’s attributes leads to an
            incoherent theology— one where God can be anything, and therefore,
            ultimately means nothing.
          </Text>{" "}
          Without any divine criteria or standard of revelation,{" "}
          <Text italic>
            “God” becomes merely a projection of the self, not a transcendent
            being worthy of worship or trust.

          5. Revealed Religion vs. Subjective Deism: A Refutation
        </Title>
        <Paragraph>
          One of the core weaknesses of deism is its reliance on{" "}
          <Text mark>personal assumption rather than divine instruction</Text>.
          In rejecting revelation, deism allows individuals to shape God’s
          nature however they see fit — leading to chaos, contradiction, and
          ultimately, confusion.
          {"\n\n"}
          In contrast, revealed religions such as Islam do not base theology on
          feeling or fantasy, but on{" "}
          <Text strong>
            divinely preserved scripture and prophetic transmission
          </Text>
          . The Quran says:
          {"\n"}
          <Text italic>
            "There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the
            All-Seeing." (Quran 42:11)
          </Text>
          {"\n"}
          This single verse affirms God's transcendence and rejects
          anthropomorphism — setting clear boundaries for understanding His
          nature.
          {"\n\n"}
          <Text underline>
            Why Revealed Religion Offers a Superior Framework:

          {"\n"}- <Text code>Consistency:</Text> God is described consistently
          across the Quran and Hadith as One, Just, Merciful, and Wise.{"\n"}-{" "}
          <Text code>Accountability:</Text> Revelation includes moral guidance
          and laws that prevent the "anything-goes" theology of deism.{"\n"}-{" "}
          <Text code>Verification:</Text> The Quran challenges readers to test
          its authenticity (e.g., Quran 2:23, 4:82) — a test no personal
          feeling-based belief can survive.
          {"\n\n"}
          <Text type="danger" strong>
            If every person invents their own version of God, truth becomes
            relative and worship becomes meaningless.

          Revelation anchors belief in divine wisdom, not human whim. The idea
          that “God told me religion is man-made” is ironic—because if that
          claim is unverifiable, it falls into the same man-made category.

          Bonus Topic: “God Told Me Religion Is Man-Made” — A Deist Claim
        </Title>

        <Paragraph>
          Some Deists assert that they’ve received a personal communication from
          God—claiming that <Text mark>organized religion is man-made</Text> and
          that <Text strong>Deism is the “true path.”</Text> This claim
          introduces a striking paradox.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          <Text underline>Firstly</Text>, classical Deism is based on the belief
          that God created the universe but does{" "}
          <Text type="danger">not intervene in it</Text>—not through miracles,
          revelations, or personal communication. If a Deist claims that God
          directly spoke to them, this violates the very foundation of Deism
          itself.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          <Text underline>Secondly</Text>, if God has communicated a message,
          that message becomes a form of <Text strong>revelation</Text>—which is
          what religious systems are built on. So ironically, such a claim
          implies the beginning of a religion or a divine communication
          system—precisely what Deism rejects.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          <Text underline>Finally</Text>, anyone claiming to have received
          divine words must answer:{" "}
          <Text italic>Why should others believe you?</Text> Without verifiable
          miracles, moral universality, or scriptural consistency, such personal
          experiences are subjective and unverifiable.{" "}
          <Text type="warning">
            Religions, on the other hand, offer tested and preserved revelations
            followed by entire communities, not isolated individuals.
          </Text>
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          In short, claiming divine speech to validate Deism results in an
          internal contradiction. It either invalidates the Deist framework or
          unintentionally leans into what religion has always maintained:{" "}
          <Text strong>
            a transcendent God who speaks, guides, and holds humans accountable.

        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph type="secondary" italic>
          P.S. — I once met a Deist who claimed God talks to him directly. So, I
          decided to test him and said, “Alright then, ask your God to tell you
          my name—if He’s really speaking to you, this should be easy.” He
          paused for a second, smiled, and said,{" "}
