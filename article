🕋 Refuting All Allegations on Muslims for Doing Eid al-Adha Sacrifice — Once and for All


---

WARNING : THIS ARTICLE IS VERY HUGE SO TAKE A CUP OF COFFEE AND RELAX AND ENJOY READING..

🐑 Introduction: The Misunderstood Ritual

Every year during Eid al-Adha, Muslims across the world perform the ritual of animal sacrifice (Qurbani) to commemorate the legacy of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) عليه السلام — who showed ultimate submission to God by being ready to sacrifice his own son Ishamel عليه السلام.

This sacrifice is:

Deeply symbolic, not just cultural.

Regulated by mercy and compassion, not bloodlust.

A charitable act that feeds millions of poor.


And yet, every year, the ritual is attacked, mocked, and demonized by:

Vegan activists, claiming it's cruelty.

Hindu nationalists, accusing Muslims of barbarism.

Western liberals and media, painting it as savage.

Even some Christians, forgetting their own past of temple sacrifices.


Let’s destroy these double standards once and for all.

🌱 1. Refuting Vegan and Animal Rights Criticism: Hypocrisy Exposed

Let’s get real:

> If you eat burgers, wear leather, or enjoy eggs and milk — don’t lecture Muslims about “animal cruelty.”



Muslims are not suddenly harming animals on Eid. Islam requires:

Animals to be fed, rested, and not mistreated.

Slaughter to be quick and painless, avoiding torture.

Parts of meat to be distributed to the poor, not wasted.


This isn’t a blood ritual or savagery. It’s a divine command rooted in compassion, gratitude, and charity — a ritual that:

Reminds us of our dependence on Allah,

Breaks the ego of the privileged,

And feeds the hungry, not fills freezers for fun.


Meanwhile:

In the West, industrial meat farming involves electrocuting, confining, and force-feeding animals, stacking them in crates, clipping beaks, snapping bones during transportation, and gassing them in slaughterhouses.

Over 150 million animals are killed every single day globally — not for God, not for reflection, not for charity, but just for fast food, greasy profits, and gluttony.

And let’s not ignore the brutal irony: Many vegans loudly support abortion-on-demand, where the unborn feel pain — but they scream about Muslims sacrificing lambs for Eid charity. That's hypocrisy dipped in soy milk.


Qurbani is mercy, not cruelty.
It connects the eater to the Creator, and to the animal itself. It’s not mindless consumption — it’s a ritual of reflection, submission, and responsibility.

🐐 Islam’s Mercy Toward Animals: Not Just Eid — Always

Islam is light-years ahead of modern “animal rights” slogans when it comes to real compassion. Unlike secular ethics, which shift with opinion polls, Islamic law has timeless rulings grounded in the sacredness of life — even animal life.

Here are examples that demolish the myth that Islam promotes cruelty:

🔹 The Prophet ﷺ said:

> “Verily, Allah has prescribed excellence in everything. If you kill, kill well. If you slaughter, slaughter well. Let one of you sharpen his blade and spare suffering to the animal.”
( Proof - Sahih Muslim 1955)



This isn't optional. It’s a command. And it’s centuries ahead of modern animal welfare guidelines.

🔹 Another Hadith:

> “Do not sharpen your knife in front of the animal. Do you want to kill it twice?”
(al-Bayhaqi, Shu’ab al-Iman)



Imagine that. Over 1400 years ago, Islam forbade psychological stress to animals — even for seconds before slaughter. While in today’s meat factories, animals see and hear others dying, screaming in fear before being stunned or sliced by conveyor belts.

🔹 A woman was condemned to Hell because she locked up a cat until it died:

> “The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "A woman entered the (Hell) Fire because of a cat which she had tied, neither giving it food nor setting it free to eat from the vermin of the earth. ".”
( Proof - Sahih Bukhari 3318 )

> "Nafi’ reported from ‘Abdullah that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: A woman was punished because she had kept a cat tied until it died, and (as a punishment of this offence) she was thrown into the Hell. She had not provided it with food, or drink, and had not freed her so that she could eat the insects of the earth."
( Proof - Sahih Muslim Book 26, Hadith Number 5570 )


This shows that cruelty to even one animal, if done intentionally and without mercy, is enough to risk damnation.

🔹 Conversely, a Prostitute was forgiven by Allah for giving water to a thirsty dog:

> “Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "A prostitute was forgiven by Allah, because, passing by a panting dog near a well and seeing that the dog was about to die of thirst, she took off her shoe, and tying it with her head-cover she drew out some water for it. So, Allah forgave her because of that."”
( Proof - Sahih Bukhari 3321)



Let that sink in: an act of mercy to a dog — an animal that many societies considered impure — earned a sinner forgiveness from the Most High.

🛑 Vegan Hypocrisy and the Religion of Emotional Extremism

Some vegans and animal rights activists claim the moral high ground. But let's ask:

Do they protest fast food chains with the same energy they attack Muslims?

Do they stop buying iPhones, knowing animal testing and human labor exploitation are involved?

Why don’t they march against the scientific labs that torture animals daily, or designer industries that skin animals alive for fashion?


No. Because this isn’t about animals.
It’s about virtue signaling, cultural supremacy, and Islamophobia dressed as ethics.

They don’t care about the sheep. They care about demonizing the people who say “Bismillah” before slaughter.


---

⚖ Islam vs Secular Ethics: Who Really Cares?

Modern secular ethics say:

> “As long as it’s efficient, mass-scale animal death is fine.”



Islam says:

> “Every single life has sacred value. Even when you slaughter, do it with ihsan (excellence).”



Western meat industries:

Mass produce death,

Disassociate consumers from the source of food,

And leave behind animal corpses, waste, and suffering.


Islamic Qurbani:

Involves clean, responsible animal care,

Conscious remembrance of God before the act,

And meat distribution to the needy — uplifting the poor, not just feeding the rich.


Which is more ethical?


---

🔥 Final Slap of Truth

If you kill animals for:

Chicken wings,

Leather belts,

Dog food,

Makeup testing...


Then sit down. You’ve lost the moral right to lecture Muslims for sacrificing an animal in the name of God, with mercy, to feed the poor.

We follow the path of Prophet Ibrahim, "the father of the prophets", whose submission was pure, Close Friend of Allah, whose legacy remains unbroken.

Qurbani isn’t cruelty. It’s spiritual clarity.
It’s not savagery. It’s sacred.

Counter Rebuttals of Possible Rebuttals from Vegans  ->

1. Rebuttal: "Islamic Slaughter is Still Unnecessary Cruelty"
Vegan Argument:
Even if Islamic slaughter (dhabihah) is more humane than factory farming, killing animals is unnecessary when plant-based diets are viable. Painless slaughter is still violence when alternatives exist.

Counter-Rebuttal:

Islam considers meat consumption permissible (halal) by divine decree, not just necessity.

Veganism is a modern privilege; many global communities rely on animal products for survival.

The ethical framework differs: Islam prioritizes divine command, gratitude, and charity over utilitarian "harm reduction."

2. Rebuttal: "Charity Doesn’t Justify Killing"
Vegan Argument:
Distributing meat to the poor doesn’t morally offset killing. Charity could be achieved through plant-based food.

Counter-Rebuttal:

Qurbani is a holistic ritual: spiritual submission + material benefit. Plant-based charity lacks the same theological significance.

In many impoverished regions, meat is nutrient-dense and culturally valued.

Vegans often ignore that crop farming also kills animals (e.g., rodents, insects) through pesticides and harvesting.

3. Rebuttal: "Hypocrisy Doesn’t Invalidate Vegan Ethics"
Vegan Argument:
Even if some vegans are hypocritical (e.g., using smartphones), it doesn’t negate the moral case against animal slaughter.

Counter-Rebuttal:

The text highlights selective outrage: why target religious practices while ignoring industrial-scale cruelty?

If consistency is demanded of Muslims (e.g., "Why kill animals at all?"), vegans must also reject all animal-derived products (medicine, clothing, etc.).

4. Rebuttal: "Abortion Comparison is False Equivalence"
Vegan Argument:
Abortion and animal rights are separate issues. Vegans can oppose both or neither without hypocrisy.

Counter-Rebuttal:

The argument critiques moral prioritization: why condemn Eid sacrifices while supporting abortion (where fetal pain is scientifically documented)?

Both debates hinge on defining "personhood" and "rights," exposing inconsistencies in secular ethics.

5. Rebuttal: "Industrial Farming is Worse, But Both Are Wrong"
Vegan Argument:
Criticizing factory farms doesn’t make Islamic slaughter ethical. Both should be abolished.

Counter-Rebuttal:

Islam regulates slaughter as a sacred act; secular industries commodify suffering. The intent matters.

Veganism’s absolutism ignores cultural/religious autonomy. Islam’s framework mandates mercy, unlike profit-driven systems.

6. Rebuttal: "Psychological Stress in Slaughter"
Vegan Argument:
Even if the blade is sharp, animals still experience fear seeing/smelling blood.

Counter-Rebuttal:

Hadith explicitly forbids sharpening knives in front of animals to avoid distress.

Modern slaughterhouses cause prolonged terror (e.g., CO2 chambers). Islamic methods minimize exposure.

7. Rebuttal: "Animal Testing ≠ Dietary Choice"
Vegan Argument:
Comparing lab testing to food consumption conflates unrelated issues.

Counter-Rebuttal:

The text critiques selective activism: why protest Eid but not cosmetics tested on animals?

Both involve animal suffering; consistency demands opposing all exploitation.

8. Rebuttal: "Virtue Signaling Claim is Ad Hominem"
Vegan Argument:
Accusing vegans of "Islamophobia" dismisses genuine ethical concerns.

Counter-Rebuttal:

The text notes disproportionate focus on Muslim practices vs. systemic cruelty (e.g., KFC, leather fashion).

Historical bias: Western animal rights groups often target non-Western traditions (e.g., whaling, halal).

9. Rebuttal: "Sacredness of Life Includes Animals"
Vegan Argument:
If Islam values animal life, why kill them at all?

Counter-Rebuttal:

Islam balances mercy with utility: animals are created for human use (Quran 36:71-72), but with strict ethical limits.

Veganism imposes an anthropomorphic view of "rights"; Islam sees humans as stewards, not equals.

10. Rebuttal: "Plant-Based Diets Are More Sustainable"
Vegan Argument:
Meat production harms the environment; Qurbani wastes resources.

Counter-Rebuttal:

Pastoralism (common in Muslim-majority regions) is eco-friendlier than industrial farming.

Qurbani’s meat distribution reduces waste vs. supermarket overproduction.

If vegans demand absolute consistency in ethics, then their philosophy collapses under its own unrealistic standards. Here’s why:

1. Crop Agriculture Kills More Animals Than Slaughter
Scientific Fact: Monoculture farming (soy, wheat, almonds) requires mass deforestation, pesticide use, and mechanized harvesting—killing billions of rodents, insects, and birds annually. (Source: USDA)

Hypocrisy: Vegans ignore these deaths because they’re "unintentional," yet they condemn intentional slaughter (like Qurbani) that feeds millions.

Conclusion: If "no animal death" is the goal, veganism fails harder than omnivory.

2. Humans Are Biologically Omnivores
Scientific Fact: Human dentition, stomach acidity, and B12 dependency prove evolutionary adaptation to meat consumption. (Source: Nature Journal)

Vegan Delusion: Supplements (B12, iron, D3) are lab-made crutches—unnatural fixes for an unnatural diet.

Conclusion: Veganism is a privileged, industrialized lifestyle, not a biological norm.

3. "Ethical" Veganism Relies on Human Exploitation
Reality Check: Avocados, quinoa, and cashews are farmed using child labor, water hoarding, and slave wages in developing nations. (Source: Oxfam)

Hypocrisy: Vegans boycott meat for "ethics" but ignore human suffering in their own supply chains.

Conclusion: Their morality is performative, not principled.

4. Lab-Grown Meat & Fake Meat Are Eco-Disasters
Scientific Fact: Cultured meat requires massive energy inputs, fetal bovine serum, and synthetic growth factors. (Source: MIT Technology Review)

Beyond/Impossible Burgers? Ultra-processed GMO soy patties with hexane-extracted protein—hardly "natural."

Conclusion: Vegan "solutions" are corporate greenwashing, not environmental saviors.

5. If Vegans Were Consistent, They’d Have to:
Ban pets (cats are obligate carnivores).

Oppose vaccines (tested on animals).

Reject modern medicine (insulin, surgeries developed via animal testing).

Live in caves (no tech, since microchips use animal-derived stearic acid).

But they don’t. Because veganism is a luxury belief, not a viable global ethic.

Final Judgment: Veganism is a First-World Fantasy
It ignores:

Biology (humans need meat).

Ecology (crop deaths > slaughter deaths).

Economics (exploitative vegan industries).

Reality (no society has ever thrived vegan).

Until vegans can:
✔️ End all animal deaths (including crop farming),
✔️ Provide natural, unprocessed nutrition without pills,
✔️ Fix human exploitation in their supply chains,

Their moral high ground is a sham.

Qurbani, hunting, and ethical farming have fed humanity for millennia. Veganism? A fleeting trend for the privileged.

Game over. 🚩

🔱 2. Refuting Hindu Criticism: Selective Outrage and Idolatrous Standards (Extended 🔥)

Some Hindutva voices scream “cow slaughter!” every Eid like it’s the apocalypse.

Let’s be honest:

> 🔹 India is one of the largest beef exporters in the world — yes, India. Not Pakistan, not Saudi Arabia. India.



So either:

1. All that beef is coming from magic cows who commit suicide, or…


2. The same hands crying “gau mata” are also busy slaughtering and exporting “mata” for profit.



Let that hypocrisy sink in.

> 🔹 Hindu scriptures include animal sacrifice — especially in Durga puja, Kali worship, and Vedic yajnas.



Read the Shatapatha Brahmana, Taittiriya Samhita, and Rigveda. You’ll find:

Animal sacrifices were common.

Cows, goats, and even horses were used.

Ashvamedha yajna (horse sacrifice) was done to show kingly dominance.

Gomedha yajna — literally means cow sacrifice.


So the same texts that are venerated in Hinduism literally record the slaughter of sacred animals — even cows.

> 🔹 Even Ram and Krishna, the beloved avatars, hunted animals.



Yes, Ram was a kshatriya (warrior) and hunted deer in forests — that’s how Sita’s abduction story starts.

In Mahabharata, meat-eating is not only mentioned — it’s discussed as a common warrior diet.

In Manusmriti (chapter 5, verses 27–44) — meat-eating is allowed and even considered pleasing to ancestors (pitrus) in yajnas. The verse from Manusmriti (5/30) states that eating meat of animals considered eatable is not sinful because Brahma (the creator) has created both the eater and the eaten. This perspective suggests that the act of consuming such meat is not inherently wrong or sinful, as it is seen as part of the natural order established by the creator.

Yet, today’s troll squads foam at the mouth when Muslims sacrifice a goat or cow in the name of Allah, with mercy, to feed the hungry?


---

🐂 Bulls, Beliefs, and Brahmanical Bullying: Let’s Flip the Analogy

If Hindus say:

> “Cow is our mother, so you can’t kill it.”



Then let’s suppose a new religion arises and says:

> “Bull is our father, so Hindus who do bull sacrifices during Jallikattu or Kambala are killing someone else’s holy figure!”



Should we storm temples? Riot? Burn homes?

NO. Because that’s absurd.

Religious belief is personal. You don’t impose your dietary taboos on others — especially in a pluralistic society.

> Islam doesn’t expect Hindus to eat beef.
Likewise, Hindus have no right to enforce gauraksha (cow protection) on Muslims.



It’s simple:

You think the cow is your mother? Great. Respect her.

But don’t try to legally, politically, or violently impose that belief on people whose religion teaches different theology.



---

🩸 Hindu Rituals: Violent, Bloody, and Brutal — But Sanitized in PR

Many Hindutva influencers criticize halal slaughter as "barbaric" — but never talk about their own rituals.

In Nepal's Gadhimai Festival, thousands of buffaloes are slaughtered in a single day in the name of the goddess. No "halal," no "mercy" — just head-chopping with blunt axes in public. Blood rivers.

In Durga puja (especially in Bengal and Assam), goats, ducks, and pigeons are sacrificed before the idol. Children watch. No pain minimization.

🔪 Their method? “Jhatka” — one big blow to the neck, no blessing, no tranquilizing, no invoking God’s name.

Compare that to Islamic halal:

Blade must be sharp (no sawing),

Animal must be fed, not stressed,

No animal should see another die,

Bismillah is said — acknowledging that this life belongs to Allah.


Islam turns slaughter into a sacred responsibility. Hindu rituals often turn it into a festival of gore.

So, who’s more humane?


---

🔥 Final Verdict: No More Hypocrisy

Here’s the brutal truth:

> You don’t get to accuse others of cruelty when your own scriptures, avatars, and rituals include hunting, sacrifice, and bloodshed.



Stop pretending Hinduism is a fluffy, vegan-friendly path of compassion.

It has violence.

It has killing.

It has contradictions.


Islam doesn’t force Hindus to eat beef.

So Hindus need to stop dictating what Muslims eat based on their own idols, beliefs, and cow-worship.

Religious pluralism means coexisting — not colonizing other people’s faith.

And if your religion says cow is your mother, don’t bring that belief into law or mob violence. Because:

> My God is not a cow. My religion is not yours. And your outrage is not justice — it’s bigotry.



K.O. ☠

Rebuttals & Counter-Rebuttals: Hindu Criticism of Islamic Slaughter
1. Rebuttal: "Hinduism Has Evolved Beyond Animal Sacrifice"
Argument:
Modern Hinduism largely rejects animal sacrifice, especially in mainstream Vaishnavism/Shaivism. Scriptural practices ≠ current beliefs.

Counter:

Selective Evolution: If Hinduism can "update" its practices, why can’t Muslims follow their unchanged divine commands?

Active Rituals: Gadhimai, Durga Puja, and tribal traditions still involve sacrifices. The claim that "all Hindus are pacifist" is false.

Hypocrisy: If animal sacrifice is "outdated," why attack Muslims for following their texts while ignoring Hindu texts that explicitly permit it?

2. Rebuttal: "Beef Export ≠ Hindu Approval"
Argument:
Beef exports are done by non-Hindus (Muslims/Christians) or corrupt businesses—not representative of Hindu values.

Counter:

Economic Complicity: If Hindus truly opposed beef, they’d ban all slaughter (like Nepal did after Gadhimai backlash). Instead, India profits from it.

Legal Double Standard: BJP-ruled states ban cow slaughter but allow buffalo exports (which are also considered "gau vansh").

Silence = Consent: No mass Hindu protests against beef exports—only against Muslim Qurbani.

3. Rebuttal: "Ram/Krishna Ate Meat, But We Don’t Anymore"
Argument:
Avatars lived in a different era; modern Hindus reject meat due to ahimsa (non-violence).

Counter:

Scriptural Authority: If Ram/Krishna’s actions are irrelevant, why cite them for other issues (e.g., Ram Mandir)?

Ahimsa Hypocrisy: Why is killing for religion (e.g., Jallikattu, Gadhimai) acceptable but halal isn’t?

Selective Pacifism: Many Hindus still eat meat (especially in Bengal, Kerala, Northeast).

4. Rebuttal: "Halal is Crueler Than Jhatka"
Argument:
Jhatka (instant decapitation) is more humane than halal (throat-cutting).

Counter:

Science Says Otherwise: Studies show throat-cutting with a sharp blade (halal) causes less pain than blunt-force trauma (Jhatka). (Source: FAO)

Islamic Rules > Hindu Rituals: Halal requires no stress before death, while Gadhimai/Durga Puja involve public terror and blunt weapons.

Hypocrisy: If Hindus cared about "painless death," they’d reform their own bloody festivals first.

5. Rebuttal: "Cow is Sacred, So Ban Its Slaughter"
Argument:
Since cows are holy to Hindus, Muslims should respect that in India.

Counter:

Religious Freedom: Muslims don’t demand bans on pig slaughter in Muslim countries for Hindus.

Logical Fallacy: If "sacredness" justifies bans, should Muslims ban alcohol because it’s haram?

Slippery Slope: Tomorrow, some sect may declare potatoes sacred—will we ban them too?

6. Rebuttal: "Hindu Outrage is Against Illegal Slaughter"
Argument:
Protests are only against cow smuggling and illegal abattoirs, not halal.

Counter:

Lynching Innocents: Mob attacks target legal transporters and even dairy farmers. (Source: Human Rights Watch)

Silence on Buffaloes: If cows are sacred, why no outrage over buffalo slaughter (same species)?

Selective Enforcement: BJP states shut down legal Muslim-run abattoirs while ignoring Hindu-run ones.

7. Rebuttal: "Hinduism Promotes Vegetarianism"
Argument:
True Hindus are vegetarian; meat-eating is a "Muslim/invader" influence.

Counter:

Historical Fact: Aryans ate beef (Rigveda 10.85.13). Brahmins in Kashmir, Bengal, and Kerala still eat meat.

Caste Hypocrisy: Upper-caste Hindus impose vegetarianism on Dalits/OBCs who traditionally ate meat.

Modern Reality: India is the world’s 2nd-largest meat consumer (after China).

Final Knockout: The Hindu Extremist Contradiction
If Hindutva activists truly believed in:
✔️ Ahimsa — They’d ban all animal slaughter (not just cows).
✔️ Scriptural Purity — They’d revive horse sacrifices (Ashvamedha).
✔️ Consistency — They’d protest buffalo exports as fiercely as cow slaughter.

But they don’t. Because this isn’t about cows—it’s about targeting Muslims.

Conclusion: Pluralism or Bigotry?
Islam allows Hindus to worship cows.

Hinduism must allow Muslims to practice halal.

Otherwise, it’s not faith—it’s fascism.


Final Scolding: Exposing Fake Hindu Outrage
Enough of the crocodile tears and performative grief over cows!

You don’t care about animals—you care about hating Muslims.

If you truly believed in "gau mata," you would:

Shut down ALL slaughterhouses, not just Muslim ones.

Ban buffalo meat exports, not just cry about cows.

Protest Gadhimai and Durga Puja sacrifices with the same rage you show for Eid.

But you don’t. Because this isn’t about compassion—it’s about politics, prejudice, and mob mentality.

You ignore your own scriptures that permit meat.
You stay silent when Hindus kill animals for festivals.
You profit from beef exports while pretending to worship cows.

Stop the hypocrisy.
Drop the fake drama.
Admit the truth: This was never about the cow—it was always about the Muslim.

Your selective outrage is exposed.
Your double standards are recorded.
Your fake emotion is a tired act.

Grow up. Be honest. Or stay silent.

The world sees through you. 🚩

Mic drop. 🎤🔥

✝ 3. Refuting Christian Hypocrisy: Remember the Old Testament?

Some Christian missionaries mock Eid al-Adha by asking:

> “Why do Muslims still sacrifice animals? That’s outdated!”



Really?

The Bible is filled with:

Animal sacrifices (Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers),

Ritual blood sprinkling,

Instructions to burn animal fat as a “pleasing aroma” to God.


Even the crucifixion theology of Christianity is based on:

> “Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.” (John 1:29)



So... sacrificing a literal man-God to forgive sins is okay,
But sacrificing a lamb to feed the poor is “barbaric”?

That’s not morality. That’s theological schizophrenia.

In Islam:

There is no human sacrifice.

There is no atonement through blood.

There is only obedience, mercy, and sharing.



---

💵 4. PETA and Western Double Standards: White Tears, Black Lies

PETA and similar groups often use shocking images of Eid sacrifice to provoke outrage. Yet:

They’re dead silent on factory farming horrors in McDonald’s, KFC, or Tyson Foods.

They protest Muslim traditions but ignore hunting, fur trade, and animal testing in the West.

They attack halal but rarely dare criticize kosher, fearing backlash.


This is not activism. It’s selective Islamophobia.

Also — let’s not forget:

Muslims use sharp knives, not dull tools.

Animals are not electrocuted, gassed, or bludgeoned, like in many Western slaughterhouses.

In Islam, saying Bismillah (in God’s name) honors the life of the animal — not treats it like a meat machine.


If you're really about animal rights — clean up your own blood-stained backyard first.


---

🕋 5. The Purpose of Qurbani: Submission and Social Welfare

Eid al-Adha is not about slaughter for pleasure. It is about:

Commemorating Ibrahim’s submission to God.

Remembering the mercy of Allah, who replaced his son with a ram.

Feeding the poor, uplifting community, and celebrating unity.


Over one-third of the meat is required to be given in charity.
Compare that with the West, where 60% of food is thrown out while people starve.

Qurbani teaches:

Responsibility,

Gratitude,

Obedience,

Sacrifice.


It’s not just halal. It’s holy.


---

☠ 6. The World is Killing Animals Daily — Just Without God

Let’s face it:

Billions of animals are killed every year globally.

Most die painfully, unnoticed, and without purpose.

No remembrance of God, no charity, no meaning.


Eid al-Adha is the opposite:

Purposeful,

Reverent,

Generous.


If the world can eat meat for taste,
Muslims can sacrifice for God and the poor.


---

🕌 Conclusion: Don’t You Dare Shame Us for Worshiping God

The world kills animals for:

Profit,

Taste,

Fashion,

Experimentation.


We kill animals:

With the name of God,

With mercy,

With charity.


So don’t come at Muslims with your media hysteria, moral double standards, and anti-Islamic bile.

We don’t need approval from PETA, Hindutva mobs, vegan influencers, or Christian missionaries.

We need the approval of Allah — and that’s what we seek on Eid al-Adha.


---

To all the trolls:

> Until you stop killing animals for fries,
Don’t dare shame us for sacrificing for the sake of God.



Qurbani is worship.
Your criticism? Just noise.
